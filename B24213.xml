            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I have told you that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Hiſtory is a <hi>French-man,</hi> and that he hath dedicated the Original to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> one of the active <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> I ſuppoſe, without other notice, you'l expect to find in it ſome affectations, I will not ſay partialities, ſuch as are uſual to Authors who write of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs wherein their Countrey have the greateſt ſhare; though, to ſpeak evenly, my Author does not ſeem very culpable in this kind. The General peace that was concluded at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> atteſts the truth of the moſt ſubſtantial matters contained in this Treatiſe. And the reſpect that is due to ſo many great men as were preſent at the Negotiation, makes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incredible that an ingenuous perſon, ſuch as the Author ſeems to be (who in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Reader wiſhes that he had not been a <hi>French man,</hi> that ſo he might have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſuſpition of partiality) would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any falſhood concerning the compliments and ceremonies which could not be ſpared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst ſo many publick Ministers, when be might ſo eaſily, and with ſhame, be by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parties concerned convicted of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39415:4"/>
            <p>You need not then doubt, but that this Book preſents you with the true lineaments and features of the ſubſtantial affairs that were treated in that famous Aſſembly, though probably the lights and air may be <hi>French,</hi> and the frame which ſets them off <hi>a-la-mode de Louis.</hi> You know as well as I, that it is uſual for ſubjects and lovers of a victorious Prince, to attribute even the most extorted and unvoluntary actions of their Master, to his free choice, and meer good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and in this strain you'l find our Author ſpeak throughout this whole Book; yet I make no doubt but that many know how much other influences, beſides the <hi>French</hi> Kings good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to give peace to <hi>Europe</hi> (and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces ſent over into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>) have had their effects in producing that Serenity which is at every turn attributed to his pleaſure. But ſeeing it is uſual in all great atchievements wherein many are concerned, that the ſeveral parties aſſume to themſelves the glory of being the chief instruments in bringing them about; I think if the diſh be good, you need not be much concerned at the manner of garniſhing it, but pleaſe your ſelf according to your humour or skill.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> what advantage this Book may afford yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, you'l find by the peruſal of
<pb facs="tcp:39415:4"/>it. And if your Stars have not destin'd you for ſuch a publick perſon as that it may prove practically uſeful to you, if they have (at leaſt) endowed you with a love of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledg, you will therein certainly meet with ſomewhat that may gratifie your curioſity. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Treaty begun at <hi>Cologn</hi> in the year 1673 under the Mediation of <hi>Suedeland,</hi> gave hopes that a general Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce would ſpeedily put an end to the War that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged then in <hi>Europe,</hi> when the ſeizure of Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and Forty thouſand Crowns taken out of the Waggons of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39415:7"/>in a Neutral City, diſcompoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in ſuch a manner that the Negotiation ſo happily begun was quite broken off.</p>
            <p>The violence committed on this Prince by the Emperors Miniſters, and the injury done to the <hi>French</hi> King, gave ground to many to fear, that Peace would not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reſtored again to <hi>Europe;</hi> and that his Majeſty would never conſent to the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Treaty, unleſs reparations were made for thoſe two injuries. Nevertheleſs at the inſtance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> (whoſe Mediation was generally embraced by all the Princes concerned in that War) and at the ſolicitation of the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> who publickly declared, That he preferred the advantages of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the liberty of his own Brother; The King made the reaſons of glory and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſtoop to the inclination which he had of contributing to the Peace of <hi>Europe.</hi> And <hi>Nimueguen</hi> being pitched upon as the place of Treaty, his Majeſty reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſend thither his Ambaſſadors Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries; and therefore on the 17 of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1675, named for that effect, the Duke of <hi>Vitry,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> and the Count <hi>D' Avaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing all the allied Princes appeared not at firſt to be of the ſame diſpoſition as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39415:7"/>to Peace, there was no advance made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the forming of the Aſſembly at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> until the month of <hi>November,</hi> that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> diſpoſed all the Intereſt-powers to ſend with all expedition their Ambaſſadors to <hi>Nimueguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King was the firſt, and gave order to his Plenipotentiaries before the end of <hi>December,</hi> to ſet out for the place of Conference; his Majeſty having allowed them but eight days to provide their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. Accordingly on the 28 of <hi>December,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> and the Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> not ſtaying for the Duke of <hi>Vitry,</hi> whoſe ſickneſs would not permit him to undertake a journey in the ſeverity of the Winter-ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>On the third of <hi>January</hi> they came to <hi>Charleville,</hi> hoping there to find Paſſports from all thoſe Princes that were concerned to give them, and eſpecially from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that they might come down to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> on the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> but the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were not in ſuch readineſs as they were made believe; ſo that one in <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> foretold the Count <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> That his ſtay in that Town ſhould be as long as that of the late Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> his Uncle, who had waited there four months for his Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, when he went to <hi>Munſter</hi> in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39415:8"/>of Ambaſſador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary for the <hi>French</hi> King, for the Treaty of the General Peace that was afterward concluded there.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors after two months ſtay, perceiving that the difficulties which were ſtarted, ſometimes about the reciprocal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſending meſſengers from <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> upon their own ſingle Paſſports, and ſometimes about the quality of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> who demanded of the <hi>French</hi> King the Titles of Brother and Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> might ſtill detain them long at <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leville,</hi> they reſolved to cauſe their Goods which were already Embarqued, to be brought aſhore again, and to wait for their Paſſports in that Town, which came at length on the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> bearing date the laſt of <hi>December</hi> in the foregoing year, with an order of Court immediately to ſet forward; accordingly they Embarked on the ſeventh of <hi>June.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſickneſs of the Duke of <hi>Vitry</hi> ſtill continued, and was thought deſperate, which obliged the King to nominate in his place the <hi>Mareſchal d' Eſtrade,</hi> who was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by his Colleagues in their paſſage at <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> and having ſtaid there only a day, on Sunday the 13 of <hi>June</hi> about one of the Clock aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n they came to <hi>Moock</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:39415:8"/>two Leagues from <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtantly put aſhore their Coaches, and moſt part of their Equipage, they ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and came to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> about five of the Clock at night.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were <hi>incognito,</hi> and without Train, having left al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all their ſervants in the Boats with the reſt of their Goods, which did not arrive till next day; yet it may be ſaid that they made a publick entry, by reaſon of the great concourſe of people who out of curioſity and impatience to ſee the ſo much wiſht-for Ambaſſadors, flocked out of the Town, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ramparts, into the ſtreets and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. The vaſt number of Waggons laden with packs of Goods that came after, and filled the whole ſtreet from the gate of the Town to the Ambaſſadors houſes, gave ground of admiration to that people, who had never ſeen the like before.</p>
            <p>The people ſeeing this, and being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> believed that the Ambaſſadors had brought with them things of vaſt value and richneſs; ſo that their houſes were preſently filled with thoſe of the Town that crouded thither to ſee them; and they were not only looked upon as ſure pledges of Peace, but alſo as a probable cauſe of the wealth of the Town.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39415:9"/>All the people being falſly perſwaded that the <hi>French</hi> were only to be blamed for the delay of the Treaty; but now ſeeing they were come, they concluded that in a ſhort time <hi>Nimueguen</hi> was to be the Theater on which the greatneſs and magnificence of <hi>Europe</hi> was to appear. Nevertheleſs matters advanced not ſo faſt as people had imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for as yet there were none at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> but Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> one of the three Plenipotentiary Mediators from <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Heers Beverning</hi> and <hi>Haren,</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors Plenipotentiary from the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſent immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to acquaint my Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> with their arrival, who rendered them the Complement, and gave them next day a viſit in a Coach with ſix Horſes. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors did the like; and the <hi>French</hi> rendered the Viſits, ſo ſoon as their Train and Equipage were in a condition to appear abroad.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhal d' Eſtrades</hi> had orders with all expedition to part from <hi>Maeſtricht;</hi> and though his Train and Equipage were not as yet in readineſs, yet he arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the 28 of <hi>June,</hi> whither Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> another of the Mediators from <hi>England</hi> came ſhortly after with my Lady <hi>Gifford</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:39415:9"/>his Siſter; my Lady <hi>Temple</hi> not coming till two months after.</p>
            <p>My Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> is a perſon of much learning, ſingular in his ways and opinions. Some judged him partial in the Mediation, and ſomewhat unequal in his humour; he is nevertheleſs a perſon of great abilities, and well acquainted with the Republican principles, as appears by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks he hath written upon the State of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> His Colleague Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> is a civil well-bred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of great integrity, and firm to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; a perſon endued with much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, who always ſhewed himſelf to be good Mediator. Theſe Ambaſſadors had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 100 <hi>l. ſterling</hi> a week, beſides an hundred and fifty pounds given them for providing their Equipage, with Furniture for the Chamber of Audience, and a ſervice of the Royal Plate, according to the cuſtom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report that came abroad at that time, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> intended to beſiege <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> ſeemed as unprobable, as the enterprize was dangerous; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Hollanders</hi> flattered themſelves with the hopes of carrying that place in a fortnights time; and it ſeemed they only waited for the departure of the <hi>Mareſhal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39415:10"/>d' Eſtrades,</hi> that they might accompliſh their deſigns; but the concluſion of that ſiege was much to the advantage of the <hi>French,</hi> who that year ſucceeded in every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that they undertook either by Sea or Land.</p>
            <p>The King in four days took <hi>Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and on the 25 of <hi>April</hi> obliged it to render on diſcretion. After five days ſiege the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> carried <hi>Bouchain</hi> on the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> in ſight of the ſtrongeſt Army that the Confederates ever had in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> under the command of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who thought it not fit to hazard a Battel with the Kings Army that lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Canon-ſhot of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aire</hi> on the laſt of <hi>July</hi> ſuffered the ſame fate. The King laid the deſign, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Louvois</hi> in the command of the <hi>Mareſhal d' Humieres</hi> put it in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Fort of <hi>Linck</hi> was taken the 9th. of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The <hi>Mareſhal</hi> Duke of <hi>Vivonne</hi> was very ſucceſsful in his Fights on the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> Seas, and in the Port of <hi>Palermo</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rnt part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet. The death of <hi>de Ruyter</hi> that happened a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before by a great ſhot that he received on board his own Ship, in an engagement againſt the <hi>French,</hi> was an irreparable loſs to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who never had an Admiral of ſo much merit and reputation.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:39415:10"/>
            <p>In the mean while it was eaſie to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what began to appear, that if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had taken <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> there was no hopes of finding the <hi>Dutch</hi> any ways inclinable to accommodation; but an event ſo contrary to their expectation, and the ruin of a great part of their Army, of which moſt of the reſidue was ſeen to march by <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> dejected them extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and made them think of other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that began to be talked of, was the Neutrality of the Country about <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> The Mediators at the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> deſired that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would extend the limits a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further. And as that conceſſion of Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality carried with it alſo an exemption from contributions, under which the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> put all the Count, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>This declaration having been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> they gave notice of it to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Their anſwer was, That if at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Monſieur <hi>Hoegh</hi> the ſecond Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary from <hi>Denmark,</hi> arrived at that time, with his Lady, at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> He is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Gentleman of a good Family, who roſe to that dignity by his good diſcharge of the ſeveral employments he hath enjoyed. He had his Lodgings in a houſe that was provided for him near the houſes of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, becauſe that being the higheſt place of the Town was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt alſo for the accommodation of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. So ſoon as he had given notice of his arrival, he was viſited by the Mediators, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo by all the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39415:13"/>reſt in Coaches of ſix Horſes, according to the Ceremony. He had of his Maſter about five hundred pounds a month, which he ſpent nobly like one that underſtood the world.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>November</hi> my Lord <hi>Barclay</hi> the chief of the Mediators, who came from being Ambaſſador Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for <hi>England</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> arrived with his Lady at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> and after ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there <hi>incognito</hi> gave notice of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; he was viſited by the other Mediators, and immediately after by the three <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſucceſſively, with two Coaches of ſix Horſes apiece.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Oxenſtierne,</hi> who with ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency demanded audience of my Lord <hi>Barclay,</hi> that he might not as it was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be prevented by the Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark,</hi> obtained it at three quarters after three; this was to be juſt after the audience of the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> who that he might loſe no time, had ſervants abroad in the ſtreets to acquaint him immediately when Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> ſhould come out from his Audience; ſo that he went to it punctually at half an hour after three. But hardly was he entered, when my Lord <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> had notice, that the Count of <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtierne</hi> was below in the Court. He bid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39415:14"/>him that he was with the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> and that the Count of <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtierne</hi> was not to have his audience till half an hour after that.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Suedeland</hi> who ſaw no body come to receive him at the foot of the ſtair, cauſed his Coachman to drive out gain, without ſtaying for the anſwer. That action ſuffered various conſtructions; for it was alledged that he could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant but that the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> was at his audience. The way to the Lodgings of my Lord <hi>Barclay</hi> was by his back-gate, where ſome of his ſervants were obſerved to be in the ſtreets, and it was not then, but exactly half an hour after three; that if he had been ignorant of it, and had had no other deſign, in that caſe he might have come back, having firſt made a ſhort turn in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> coming out; or if he pretended that his viſit was actually performed, as he did afterwards, he ought to have ſent his Colleague to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience immediately after the Count <hi>d' Avaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever the matter was, whether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or a laid deſign, as many did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves it was, though they could not conceive the policy of that enterpriſe, the buſineſs was taken up by the Mediation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39415:14"/>of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors. The Viſit was held to be performed, and yet my Lord <hi>Barclay</hi> never render'd it, nor ſaw the Count of <hi>Oxenſtern,</hi> but accidentally, as it were, at Madam <hi>Colberts</hi> Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The unexpected Peace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Poland</hi> and the <hi>Turk,</hi> the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> began to gain upon the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Elſinbourg,</hi> and the Succors put into <hi>Malmoe,</hi> the vigorous reſiſtance of the Town of <hi>Stetin,</hi> from before which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> was at that time forced to raiſe the ſiege; all that, I ſay, and beſides the progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Arms in <hi>Sicily,</hi> made it believed that the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates would at length appear more tractable than hitherto they had been.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count of <hi>Kinſdi,</hi> the ſecond of the Emperors Ambaſſadors, continued ſtill at <hi>Cologne,</hi> detained, as it was ſaid, by the Gout; and <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo,</hi> the ſecond Ambaſſador from <hi>Spain,</hi> coming from <hi>England,</hi> where he had been but Envoy Extraordinary, ſtayed ſtill at the <hi>Hague,</hi> expecting the reſt of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage from <hi>England:</hi> but being at length arrived at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> he continued long <hi>incognito,</hi> becauſe having no other chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter but that of Plenipotentiary, the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39415:15"/>Ambaſſadors refuſed to give him the hand.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Somnitz</hi> and <hi>Blaſpiel,</hi> the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> who had been ſometime at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> on the 29. of <hi>December</hi> gave notice of their arrival. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and afterwards with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, becauſe contrary to what was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed at <hi>Munſter,</hi> both the Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> demanded the hand and title of Excellence. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would not give it, but to him that was firſt named in the Commiſſion; and upon occaſion of that difficulty, viſited them not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators made their viſit, but with a reſolution not to give the title of <hi>Excellence</hi> ſave only to Mr. <hi>Somnitz,</hi> nor to demand audience of Mr. <hi>Blaſpiel.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever being both lodged in the ſame houſe, the ſecond failed not to be at the audience; and the firſt perceiving that the Mediators addreſſed their diſcourſe only to him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them his Colleague, giving him the title of <hi>Excellence.</hi> But they anſwered, that their viſit was only to him. The Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſtuck not at theſe formalities, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to do with the Miniſters of one of the chief of his Maſters Allies. But the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39415:15"/>
               <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors followed the example of the <hi>French:</hi> So that the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgs</hi> Miniſters found themſelves far enough from being able to eſtabliſh their pretenſion at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi>

            <p>The States General, who payed great Subſidies to the Princes that were confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with them, began at that time to think of retrenching that great expence; and they thought they had the greater reaſon, that they needleſly drained their Treaſury by the charge of a War, which was now become wholly that of their Confederates, unto which they ought to have no greater concern, than in a publick and common aſſault.</p>
            <p>What glory ſoever redounded to the States General, in that they could reckon among their Penſioners, the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors almoſt, the Princes of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter;</hi> yet that hindered them not from acquainting them with the inability they lay under to continue thoſe great Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, excepting only the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> in conſideration of the new Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that he had made with them, and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> of whoſe humour and Neighbourhood the States General have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39415:16"/>been always apprehenſive. They did not as yet cut off thoſe ſubſidies; but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors declared to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Allies, that they would pay none for the enſuing Campagn, unleſs they put the <hi>French</hi> in the wrong; that is, if they made it not appear by their refuſal of reaſonable propoſitions, that if the peace were not concluded, the <hi>French</hi> were only to be blamed for it.</p>
            <p>By this means the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtopt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates mouths, they obliged them to haſten the opening of the Conferences, to which no ſtep had hitherto been made; and put themſelves in right of complaining of thoſe who for their own private intereſts deſired not to ſee the War ſo ſoon put to an end; and therefore they thought it not enough to ſpeak of cutting off the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but began alſo to hint at a ſeparate and particular Treaty, in ſuch a manner that the Confederates took the allarm the more eaſily, in that the exceſſive charges the States General had been at during this War, had been exceeding burdenſome to all the Provinces.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Kinski</hi> arrived at length at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the third of <hi>January</hi> 1677. He is a <hi>Bohemean</hi> Gentleman, never before em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any Embaſſie; and therefore all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39415:16"/>his actings were in the beginning full of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and diffidence; but it appeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that he had more ſincere intentions for peace than his Colleagues had, with whom he claſhed ſo as not to be reconciled again. He is a valetudnary man, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, but of great merit and ſagacity. He had two thouſand <hi>German</hi> Florins a month, which make about three hundred and thirty pounds <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> remained <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito</hi> above a month; and neither he nor the other Miniſters of the Confederates ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act with the ſame frankneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity the <hi>French</hi> did, even in the opinion of my Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Temple,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that it was not to be doubted but that the <hi>French</hi> inclined to peace, and that they were like thoſe Gameſters who having won conſiderably, were willing to leave play if the loſers obliged them not to continue.</p>
            <p>In the mean time thoſe who examined without paſſion the preſent ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the intereſts of moſt part of the Princes engaged in the War, wonder'd that they would continue it with ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, upon hopes that were not too firmly grounded. <hi>Holland</hi> had nothing to gain, and loſt much by the exceſſive char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the War. The Emperor ſaw himſelf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39415:17"/>raiſed to the real height of his greatneſs by the ſetling his Authority throughout the whole Empire; but had hardly any means left of procuring Winter-quarters for the Impetial Troops; and moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were ſo tired out and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by the War, that it was to be feared his Imperial Majeſty might find himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned in time of need. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> had almoſt all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> joyned in his Intereſts, and could never promiſe himſelf ſuch aſſiſtance in any other juncture; but what advantage had he from that, ſeeing notwithſtanding the <hi>French</hi> took the beſt places of the <hi>Low Countreys? Cambray</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes</hi> were at that time ſo ſtraitly blocked up, that it was not doubted but one of thoſe places would be loſt before the beginning of the Campagn. None but the Northern Confederates were inclined to the continuation of the War, through the deſire of preſerving, and even enlarging the Conqueſts they had made upon <hi>Sueden.</hi> But a Victory obtained by the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> made it hopeful that the <hi>Suedes</hi> renewing their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage under ſo great a Prince, might ſet their affairs to rights again. Though the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> loſt moſt in this War, yet the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of that Crown acted with greateſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39415:17"/>ſlowneſs as to the advancement of the peace. The reaſon of their procedure in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, could be attributed to nothing but the uſual irreſolution of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and yet it was not very eaſie for them in the preſent juncture of affairs to determine themſelves. The removal of <hi>Valenſuela,</hi> the firſt Miniſter of State in that Court, and the return of <hi>Don John</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> being ſupported by all the Nobility of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt the Intereſts of the Queen-Regent, made people fear ſome dangerous revolution; inſomuch that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abandoned the fate of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> to the protection of their Confederates. However it might have been ſaid at that time, that a real Lethargy had ſeized mens minds, and hindered them from applying themſelves with care to the means of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſolid peace.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep: That King cauſed a conſiderable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men to march into <hi>Flanders</hi> in the depth of Winter. This ſtruck a terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39415:18"/>Aſſembly was not as yet formed, neither were the preliminaries to the Peace as yet condeſcended on.</p>
            <p>At that time the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had notice given them, that the Count of <hi>Kinski</hi> received the viſits of the Miniſters of the Confederates, and were ſurpriſed at that manner of conduct, though it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, that they were but private viſits among friends, upon occaſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements he made to them upon his arrival at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> However the Mediators un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that complement to be a real no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his arrival, becauſe that the King of <hi>England</hi> deſiring that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors ſhould make no publick entry into <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> for avoiding ſeveral accidents which ſuch Ceremonies uſually produce they ought not neither to give notice or their arrival twice; and therefore they ſent preſently to deſire audience of him next day at two of the clock, for it was then ten of the clock at night.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors deſired to have a clear underſtanding as to the Emperors Ambaſſador his carriage in that particular; but after that the Mediators had taken much pains to adjuſt the matter, the <hi>French</hi> found in the conduct of the Count of <hi>Kinski</hi> neither ſincerity enough, nor ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſecurity, but that ſome Ambaſſadors might therefrom draw advantages to the prejudice of that precedency which they pretended to be due to <hi>France.</hi> That Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In the mean time to content the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, they gave them the choice of what place they pleaſed in the great Town-hall; whither they went to pitch upon the place which they found moſt convenient to meet in when they thought fit; though they being by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and having none to confer with but the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden,</hi> they needed no ſuch Apartment; and it is probable that if the Miniſters of the Confederates had foreſeen that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſhould have diſpoſed of the Town-Hall, they would not have pitched upon the place which they had choſen.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:39415:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The moſt remarkable paſſage that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Aſſembly of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates was, that after the Count of <hi>Kinski,</hi> who as Ambaſſador from the Emperor had taken his place at the upper end of the Table, the Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador for the next place on the right hand; inſomuch that <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> was forced to conſent to have it only by turns; and for deciding which of the two ſhould have it at their firſt ſitting, they behoved to caſt lots for it, whereby it fell to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador. The ſame difficulty aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ambaſſadors of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> who although they were at home, yet would not yield it; inſomuch that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was determined in the ſame manner as the former.</p>
            <p>The Forces of the <hi>French</hi> King began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to break into <hi>Flanders,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the coldneſs of the ſeaſon; and the talk was, that ſome conſiderable ſiege would be ſpeedily made. On the other ſide the <hi>French</hi> King put the frontiers of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> out of a condition of being able to furniſh proviſions to any great Army, with which he was threatned from thence. And the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39415:21"/>made a Declaration to the Diet at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon,</hi> whereby he quaſhed the hopes that the Confederates had conceived after the death of the Electoreſs, of his joyning his forces with thoſe of the Empire, againſt the Power of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Prince declared, that he never had conſented to the War into which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was engaged upon occaſion of the <hi>Dutch</hi> War: He proteſted he was ſo far from contributing to it on his part, that he had Twenty thouſand men in readineſs to act againſt thoſe that ſhould refuſe a Peace; and that he would punctually obſerve the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> on which the ſafety and repoſe of the Empire depended. Which was a ſufficient Declaration in favour of <hi>France,</hi> that ſeemed to demand no more in <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <hi>France.</hi> The five chief Confederates, to wit, the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark, States of Holland,</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> deſired that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them ſeverally, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors might have five particular Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But the <hi>French</hi> would only procure two, one for treating with the Catholick Princes, in which the Mediation of the Pope was mentioned; and the other for the Proteſtant Princes who owned not that Mediation; and they abſolutely refuſed to preſent one for the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> leſt that all the other Princes of the Empire ſhould pretend to the like. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſe that no other Commiſſion ſhould be demanded, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors judging it the intereſt of the King their Maſter to treat ſeparately with the Confederates, they were not ſo ſtiff in that matter, and the rather eſpecially that they might thwart the Count of <hi>Kinski,</hi> who would have managed the intereſts of all the Confederates, and deprived them of the liberty of acting by themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador was the moſt ſcrupulous about theſe Plenary Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; he ſtood upon the giving of his in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> language, if he muſt have that of the <hi>Frenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He alledged that the King his Maſter ſtood not on the ſame foot as heretofore, and that he might very well challenge a right of eſtabliſhing a new cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. But the <hi>Danes</hi> got nothing by this, they were fain to condeſcend to the old way, which is that the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters ſpeak to them in French, and that they anſwer them in Latin.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of <hi>March</hi> 1676/7. all the Ambaſſadors gave in their propoſitions of peace to the Mediators, whereby the pretenſions of all the powers concerned in the war were made known; and on the 5th they were interchanged by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> propoſed to the Emperour and Empire, that the King having not deſired any thing more paſſionately than the religious

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> ſaid, That the King being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Juſtice, and the obligation of the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapel,</hi> attacqued by the Catholick King, his Majeſty had reaſon to pretend that in reſpect of that Crown, all things ſhould remain in the condition that the fortune of War had put them into, without prejudice to his Majeſties Rights, which were to continue ſtill in full force and power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> pretended that <hi>France</hi> ſhould give them compleat ſatisfaction, and reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39415:23"/>all the charges of the War: and by four Articles they demanded of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> that betwixt the two Kingdoms and two Kings, all things ſhould be reſtored into the ſame condition as they were before the War that was ended by the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> and that the Treaties of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen</hi> ſhould be aboliſhed; and that all the Provinces which had been diſmembred from <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the <hi>Danes;</hi> that all that the <hi>Suedes</hi> poſſeſt in the Empire, ſhould be taken from them; that <hi>Wiſmar</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Rugen</hi> ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and that for the ſecurity of his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty and Kingdoms, they might put Gariſons in all the ſtrong places of <hi>Sueden</hi> that lye upon the frontiers of the two Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The propoſitions of <hi>France</hi> in reference to the <hi>Danes</hi> were, That ſeeing the King had not declared War againſt the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but he runs contrary to the Treaty of <hi>Copenhagen</hi> made in the year 1660. for performance whereof the King was Guarantee; the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had attacqued <hi>Sueden:</hi> His moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was ready to deſiſt from hoſtility on his part, provided that the aforeſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and thoſe of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> were re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:39415:23"/>
            <p>In reſpect of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> the States General demanded, That <hi>Maeſtricht, Dalen, Fangumont,</hi> and all the dependencies of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> ſhould be reſtored to them: That they were willing for the publick peace to ſacrifice the ineſtimable loſſes, whereof they might pretend reparation; and that for avoiding all differences for the future, the Treaty might contain a general and particular renuntiation of all ſorts of pretenſions.</p>
            <p>There were afterward ſixteen Articles concerning the full ſatisfaction to be made to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in regard of what depended on the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and particularly the reſtauration of the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of <hi>Orange,</hi> that were ruined in the year 1660. and of the Caſtle demoliſhed in the year 1663. the rights of Toll upon Salt and other Commodities, as well upon the <hi>Rone,</hi> as through the Principality of <hi>Orange;</hi> the rights of Coyning of money, of Laick Patronage for nomination to the Biſhoprick; the exemptions, priviledges, and other Immunities granted to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that Principality by the Kings his Majeſties Predeceſſors, and particularly by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſtates General</hi> demanded nothing of <hi>Sueden,</hi> but that the future Treaty might
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39415:24"/>contain ſome regulations for obviating the frequent inconveniences that happened concerning Commerce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> propoſed to the <hi>States General,</hi> That ſeeing the Union that hath always been betwixt the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States,</hi> was only interrupted upon account of ſome cauſes of diſcontent, which were eaſie at preſent to be removed, and to be prevented for the future; His Majeſty was willing to reſtore the <hi>States General</hi> to his former amity, and to hearken favourably to all propoſitions that might be made to him on their part, even concerning a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Commerce. And as to the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made for the re-eſtabliſhment of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made an anſwer to them; but upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion oppoſed the pretenſions of the Count <hi>D' Auvergne,</hi> demanding that his Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate and Town of <hi>Bergen-op-zoom</hi> might be reſtored to all the rights of Soveraignty which the other Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conform to the Treaties of Pacification of <hi>Ghent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> demanded that <hi>France</hi> ſhould make reparation for the damages that his Territories had ſuſtained by the <hi>French</hi> Forces during the courſe of this War, that all ſecurity ſhould be given
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39415:24"/>him for the future for the ſame Territories, and that all his Allies ſhould be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a general Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> made no propoſitions to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> beſides thoſe that were made to the Emperor and Empire, which comprehended the full performance of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all the propoſitions that the <hi>Suedes</hi> made to the Emperor, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>States General,</hi> and to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the one but the renovation of their former amity and good correſpondence, and of the others the execution of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> which contained the reſtitution of all that had been taken from that Crown.</p>

               <hi>French</hi> King had granted the title of Duke, with a general proteſtation made to the Mediators, that the titles taken or given ſhould be without prejudice, cauſed his propoſitions to be made, by which he ſaid, That as heir to his Predeceſſors, he hoped from the Juſtice of the King that he would reſtore to him his Dutchies of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> with their dependencies, his titles, records, movables, and effects taken from him, and make reparation for the Towns,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39415:25"/>Burroughs, Caſtles and Villages that were ruined throughout all his Dominions.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Miniſters of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates would not admit of the Sieur <hi>Duker,</hi> the Envoy of the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> King reckoned among the Confederate Princes, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors made no propoſitions concerning <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> nor ſhewed any Plenary Commiſſion for treating about the Intereſts of that Prince (though much urged to it by the Confederates) that by this means they might oblige the Imperialiſts to own the Miniſter of the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the propoſitions of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> which the Sieurs <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lkens</hi> and <hi>Wetterkop,</hi> that Princes Envoys, had put into the hands of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, lay there without anſwer or being interchanged, becauſe the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor hindred the Miniſter of that Prince from being admitted, as being an Ally of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and protected by <hi>France,</hi> and upon that account diſpoſſeſſed of his Territories by the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſitions of the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> were not made publick, becauſe the Miniſters of thoſe Princes kept <hi>incognito,</hi> pretending to the character and rank of Ambaſſadors; yea,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39415:25"/>and theſe Princes wrote to the King of <hi>England</hi> for obtaining the effect of their Pretenſions: but what inſtance ſoever they made during the whole courſe of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, no Crowned head yielded to their demand.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <p>I have here but inſerted the ſubſtance of the firſt propoſitions of Peace; yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be ſeen how unreaſonable the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> were, ſeeing that not only the Mediators, but even the Ambaſſadors of the States General thought them exorbitant.</p>
               <p>The ſixth of this Month Monſieur <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> gave the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors notice of his arrival; who at the ſame time ſent each of them a Secretary, to make him their complement, and demand audience, either the ſame morning, or immediately after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But he excuſed himſelf, ſaying that he had a buſineſs of great importance to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch that day with an Envoy of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Cologn,</hi> concerning urgent affairs of his Imperial Majeſty, and appointed them ſix of the clock at night. The <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors began then to doubt of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his conduct towards them, and they could not imagin what pretext he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39415:26"/>could have. It is true, the Gentleman that made the complement to the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors in the name of Mr. <hi>Stratman,</hi> had waited ſometime at the lodgings of the Count <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> where at that time they were all three together; but the time was but ſhort, and the Ambaſſadors ſaw very well that Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> failed in what was due to their Character, though he aſſured them that he had ſent his Secretary to them, and that he had taken all the meaſures that he conceived neceſſary to give them all manner of ſatisfaction. Whatever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, the great affair that Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> pretended to be for the important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Emperor, was no more indeed but that he might have leiſure at two of the clock to receive the viſit of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and at four of the clock that of the firſt Ambaſſador of <hi>Sueden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors cauſed all the circumſtances of Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi>'s conduct to be obſerved: nevertheleſs the made their viſit all three together at ſix of the clock at night, with ſeven Coaches and ſix Horſes a piece, a great number of ſervants in Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Flambeaux; inſomuch that there had not as yet ſo ſplendid a Train been ſeen at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> Theſe Ambaſſadors intended to put Monſieur <hi>Stratman</hi> in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39415:26"/>wrong; they knew very well that the real diſtinction of preference is not to be made according to the order that viſits are given in, but according to the order they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by thoſe who have received them: as to that, they expected to ſee how Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> would carry towards them, that they might thereupon take their meaſures with him.</p>
               <p>It was above a fortnight before Mr. <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> put himſelf in a condition of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any viſit; during which time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an indiſpoſition.

In the mean time he made an apology for that delay in a Letter which he wrote to the Marſhal <hi>D' Eſtrades,</hi> imputing it to an indiſpoſition that had ſeized him. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors ſent a Gentleman to make him a complement, and condole with him about his ſickneſs: To whom he anſwered, That he hoped ſuddenly to be in a condition to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>No man doubted but that Monſieur <hi>Stratman</hi> found himſelf in ſome perplexity, and that he was very ſenſible how hard a task it would be for him to go on as he had begun, without expoſing himſelf to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome conſequences. He perceived how the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had deported themſelves towards the Count of <hi>Kinski,</hi> who would have obſerved a particular way of conduct as to them. He underſtood that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would refuſe his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, if he failed in giving them the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and he was ignorant, that if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure ſhould deprive him of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſeeing the Ambaſſadors during the whole time of the Treaty, it might be a conſiderable prejudice and obſtacle to the peace.</p>
               <p>At length the 22. Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> ſent to demand audience of the Marſhal <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrades,</hi> but not till he had viſited the firſt Ambaſſador of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and ſent in formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to demand audience of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who was not then in Town. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had agreed among themſelves about the anſwer that was to be given to the Gentleman that ſhould demand audience; ſo that ſo ſoon as he had made his complement, the Marſhal <hi>D' Eſtrades</hi> told him, that Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> knew not what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39415:27"/>was due to the King his Maſter, and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and that therefore he would not admit of his viſit.

               <p>The laſt inſtance ſignified nothing for confirmation of their pretenſion.

               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained alſo of the publick refuſe which the <hi>French</hi> made of the viſit of Mr. <hi>Stratman.</hi> The cauſe of thoſe miſunderſtandings was imputed to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who finding themſelves always thwarted in the equality which they ſo ſtrongly pretend to with <hi>France,</hi> contend not for it with other Crowns, to the end they may unite them all, and ſo oppoſe themſelves with greater force to the precedency which <hi>France</hi> claims, or at leaſt to diſturb it as much as they can,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39415:29"/>in the poſſeſſion of an advantage which they cannot obtain for themſelves.</p>
               <p>There was an innovation made at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> of what was practiſed at <hi>Cologn</hi> in regard of the Mediators, to whom in that quality all the Powers had granted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency in the affairs that concerned the Mediation. And the Mediators on their parts being deſirous to prevent all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of quarrels, which frequently happen upon occaſion of Livery-men, eſpecially when many of different Nations meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, perſwaded all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors in the firſt place to command their Pages and Lacqueys to wear no ſwords; which was punctually obſerved. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of the ſtreets of <hi>Nimueguen</hi> are ſo narrow, that two Coaches can hardly paſs a breaſt, the Mediators drew up a writing to be ſigned by all the Ambaſſadors, by means whereof they did ſufficiently obviate all the inconveniences which were to be feared during the Treaty.</p>
               <p>That writing bore, That in conſideration of the narrowneſs of the ſtreets, when two Coaches going contrary ways ſhould meet, that Coach which ſhould be leaſt advanced into the ſtreet, ſhould put back, without any conſequence to be drawn therefrom, or prejudice to any ones pretenſions; that he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39415:29"/>that ſhould moſt punctually obey that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhould be held to be the moſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards the peace; the matter being thus concerted for no other end, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all occaſions of quarrelling, and to keep thoſe who laboured for the reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publick repoſe, in goodintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were the firſt who ſigned that writing, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> did the like, and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their example: but the matter went no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that it was to be feared that ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident might afterwards happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many Ambaſſadors; but the order that was made for preventing any diſorder amongſt ſervants, was punctually put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>There happened at that time long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates concerning the manner of treating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the affairs of the peace, and that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not eaſily adjuſted: all the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were for having it managed only by writing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors maintained, that having given in their firſt propoſitions in writing, the way of treating by word of mouth with the Mediators was the ſhorteſt. The Confederates would not condeſcend to this, but made very long anſwers in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39415:30"/>to the <hi>French</hi> propoſitions, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather invectives than anſwers to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of peace. But the <hi>French</hi> waving all theſe diſputes, which produce always ſtrife, gave their anſwers verbally by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. the <hi>Dutch</hi> were the firſt that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this method, and all the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates at length yielded to this way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the moſt expedient for diiſpatching in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> continued ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> whither Mr. <hi>Chriſtu</hi> arrived on the 18th of <hi>March.</hi> This Third Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> is a <hi>Fleming,</hi> Doctor in the Laws, and Counceller in the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Council in <hi>Spain,</hi> who hoped to have the Office of Chancellour of <hi>Brabant,</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his ſervices. In the mean time the News of the ſiege of <hi>Valenciences,</hi> before which the King came the firſt of this Month, made all people very impatient to know the ſucceſs of that enterpriſe, it being known what care and circumſpection had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the preſerving of that place; but the news that came of the Trenches being opened the Ninth in the night time, was quickly followed with the taking of the place on the 17th about Nine in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:39415:30"/>
               <p>The manner of taking <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized all men, and daunted the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The King commanded the Counter-ſcarp to be attacqued with two Half-moons that flanked a Crowned work, and that they ſhould lodg on the front of that work, which covers another that is before the Gate of the Town. But the Kings forces marching croſs thoſe Half-moons, attacqued that great Crowned-work on the front and ſides, and entered it on all hands, killed or made Priſoners all that oppoſed them, and purſuing thoſe that ſaved themſelves in the Town, gained the Bridg and ſecond Work, and by a Wicket where they could not paſs but one after another, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the Town-gate; ſo that in leſs than half an hour the King ſaw a place of that conſequence taken by force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 1677, The Confederates hoped that the ſiege of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> begun in ſo bad a ſeaſon, would have ruined a great part of the Kings forces; but that Conqueſt with others that were foreſeen would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, much diſheartened them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Treaty of Peace went on but very ſlowly for all that. The Confederates groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their hopes on the great Exploits that the <hi>German</hi> Forces were to perform in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia,</hi> and on the Declaration of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:39415:31"/>which they expected in their ſavours, not doubting but that the Parliament would ſollicite the King to join with them for oppoſing the progreſs of the <hi>French;</hi> but the Confederates at that time found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much diſappointed in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The two Houſes of Parliament repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King of <hi>England</hi> the neceſſity of putting a ſtop to the progreſs that the <hi>French</hi> made in the <hi>Low-countries.</hi> The King anſwered thoſe that made him the Addreſs from the Parliament, That it was the thing he had in his thoughts, and that he ſhould take care that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not be in a condition of giving jealouſie to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that his Subjects ſhould have no cauſe to have any. His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was afterwards informed, that <hi>Don Bernardo de Salinas,</hi> Envoy from <hi>Spain,</hi> gave it out, that his Majeſty had called the Authors of that Addreſs Rogues. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of that Miniſter ſo much the more offended the King of <hi>England,</hi> as that in ſo nice a juncture, it might have produced dangerous effects in his Kingdoms; and therefore he ſent order to <hi>Don Pedro de Salinas</hi> to keep within doors, and to make ready to depart out of the Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty days.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:39415:31"/>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors in the mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> like Spectators; and all that was done there, was to conſider and obſerve what paſſed in the <hi>Low countries,</hi> where after the taking of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> the King made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Cambray</hi> on the third of <hi>April,</hi> five days after the Trenches were opened, the Governour with the whole Garriſon having retreated into the Cittadel; and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> who till then had only held St. <hi>Omers</hi> blocked up, cauſed at the ſame time the Trenches to be opened. But upon notice that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> marched with a great Army to the relief of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> the King detached from his Army the Mareſhal of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> with Eight Battalions, the two Troops of his Muſquetiers, and ſome Dragoons, reſerving only ſo many of his forces as were neceſſary for forcing the Cittadel of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Detachment came in the nick of time to ſtrengthen the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his Army; for on the eleventh the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies engaged near to <hi>Mont-caſſel,</hi> and had a ſharp diſpute; but after a vigorous reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made by the <hi>Dutch</hi>-Infantry, the <hi>French</hi> got the day, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> in that defeat loſt eight thouſand men that wert killed or made Priſoners, many Colours, eight pieces of Cannon, two mortar-pieces, all their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39415:32"/>groſs Baggage, and many Waggons laden with Arms and Ammunition for the relief of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> which was the chief fruit of the Battel.</p>
               <p>The news of that victory, the taking of <hi>Cambray</hi> on the eighteenth, and of St. <hi>Omers</hi> on the twentieth, ſtunned the Confederates, and ſo many Conqueſts in ſix weeks time, and before the uſual time of the Compagn, made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſpair of being able to preſerve any thing in <hi>Flanders,</hi> if peace did not put a ſtop to thoſe progreſſes; but that which troubled them moſt, was, that by theſe Conqueſts t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> being come to <hi>Weſel,</hi> there was a great Conference held there concerning the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes which the <hi>German</hi> forces were to undertake in three ſeveral places.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39415:32"/>of <hi>Newbourg</hi> was there in perſon. But the great advantages that the <hi>French</hi> King had juſt then obtained, diverted the deſigns which the Confederates had again formed upon <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many were perſwaded that the loſs which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had then ſuſtained, would incline them to treat about a ſeparate Peace; if the <hi>States-General</hi> were as deſirous of it as the people; and all that wiſhed well to the publick, ſeemed impatient to ſee themſelves delivered from ſo troubleſome a War. They could not have a better pretext for it, than the loſs of the battel of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſel,</hi> and the ſudden return of the <hi>Heer Beverning,</hi> who upon that news came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently back to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> confirm'd the conjecture that ſome had of a particular accommodation betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> That Ambaſſador appeared always ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the real intereſt of his Countrey, that if there was any ſeparate Treaty to be expected, it could no ways be managed but by his means; and if different intereſts had not always divided the <hi>States-General,</hi> it would not have been long before they had broken off from the Confederates, whoſe hopes daily vaniſhed, though they could not reſolve to ſave themſelves from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of War by a good Peace, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39415:33"/>appeared to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be the moſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſafe way to remedy the preſent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and prevent thoſe wherewith they were threatned.</p>
               <p>After this ſhort, but no inglorious Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, the <hi>French</hi> King diſperſed his Forces into quarters of refreſhment; and being at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> ſent the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to carry him a Letter, whereby his Majeſty declared, That though his willingneſs to come to peace did not at all promote the concluſion thereof; yet he was ready, amidſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities wherewith Heaven was pleaſed to favour him, to conſent to a general Truce for ſome years, as the ſureſt means of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tranquility to <hi>Europe,</hi> provided that the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> was of the ſame mind. And ſeeing his Majeſty could have no free correſpondence with that Prince, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King of <hi>England</hi> to inform himſelf of his intentions, not doubting but that he was ſufficiently perſuaded of the ſincere deſire he had to ſecond the good offices of his Mediation, yea and to contribute all that in him lay, for the procuring of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace, though he might have ground to expect conſiderable advantages from his Armies.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:39415:33"/>
               <p>In the mean time it was the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that the <hi>French</hi> King did but make formal demonſtrations of deſiring a Peace, whilſt he found himſelf ſo ſucceſsful, and ſo powerful, as to make himſelf Maſter of all the <hi>Low-Countreys;</hi> that if he did really conſent to a Truce, he muſt either think himſelf too weak to bear up againſt the efforts that were preparing to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> or that he intended ſome enterpriſe into which they could not dive. Some gave out, that the <hi>French</hi> King's Letter was but a politick fetch, whereby he gave occaſion to the King of <hi>England</hi> to wave the Declaration which his Parliament ſo urgently ſolicited; and that the condition of the King of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s conſent would be always a ſure pretext to ſtave off the propoſition of the Truce, whenever <hi>France</hi> though it convenient.</p>

               <p>The ſame day (<hi>May</hi> 1677.) that that Letter was brought to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors having demanded audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>French,</hi> came all to the Houſe of the Marſhal <hi>D' Eſtrades,</hi> whither they brought the project of a Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the Articles of which were extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the laſt Treaties which they made with <hi>France.</hi> But the people ſaid publickly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39415:34"/>That that was but to amuſe them to no purpoſe; that it was much better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Treaty of Peace than a Treaty of Commerce.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39415:36"/>whence he was ſent Mediator to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. who at preſent fills the Holy See. Although the allowance of great Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's exceed not 370. <hi>Roman</hi> Crowns a month, and that he was not well paid, his Train was nevertheleſs ſplendid, and his Houſe well ordered. His civil and familiar carriage gained him the affection of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and his good intentions towards the Peace, made him to be equally reſpected by all the Ambaſſadors.</p>
               <p>Next day after his arrival, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſent three Gentlemen together, to teſtifie the joy they had for his happy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and to offer him all the civilities they were able to perform, impatiently expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fit time to come and ſalute him in perſon. The three Gentlemen were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Nuncio according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Chamber of Audience, upon three elbow-chairs. They ſpoke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and were conducted by the Nuncio as far as the dore of the outer anti-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that looked into the Court. The ſame honour was done to the Gentleman that render'd that compliment on his part; and the day following after noon the three Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>France</hi> went ſeverally to viſit the Nuncio <hi>incognito</hi> and on foot, his houſe being diſtant but a few ſteps from thence;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39415:36"/>yet they were followed by all their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Emperors Ambaſſadors were there alſo in the morning <hi>incognito.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the fifth of <hi>June,</hi> the Nuncio gave notice of his arrival to the two Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Emperor, who had their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick audience at five of the clock after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; and to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, who viſited him at ſeven of the clock, with a train of ſeven Coaches and ſix horſes a piece. The Towns-people were very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſee ſuch ceremonies, but much more for this, being impatient to ſee how a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio of the Pope looked. The Burgomaſters of the Town, and a great number of other perſons placed themſelves in the Windows of the Neighbouring houſes to ſee him at his gate, whilſt he received and re-conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ambaſſadors to their Coaches. He was in a plain long purple habit lined with ſcarlet, and carried a Croſs of Diamonds; but he was cloathed commonly in a ſhort habit. No body wondered at the curioſity of that people, ſeeing it was a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing to ſee a Pope's Nunior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39415:37"/>Ambaſſador ſent from the Pope, of whom their Miniſters give them an hideous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>The Burgomaſters of <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the neutrality of the Town, and of the Negotiation of ſo great a work as that of a general Peace, viſited the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, and offered him all they could do for the free exerciſe of the Catholick Religion; but he was ſatisfied to have a large Chappel only in his houſe, whither Catholicks might freely come, as they did to the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Chappel, where ſervice was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on Feſtival-days with all the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that is uſual in Pariſh-Churches, having even placed a Bell in the top of a Tower, which was heard over a great part of the Town.</p>
               <p>Some days before the arrival of the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, a Jeſuit belonging to the Family of <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo,</hi> went about the ſtreets in the habit of his Order; this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſtrange a thing, that it ſtirred up the curioſity of all the people; and therefore the Magiſtrates fearing leſt ſuch Novelties might occaſion ſome diſorder, publiſhed next day an Order under the pain of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, That no body ſhould ſay or do any thing to any perſon whatſoever, whatever Eccleſiaſtical habit they ſhould
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39415:37"/>ſee them wear. But Don <hi>Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> thought it not fit that that Jeſuit ſhould appear any more abroad in that manner. The Nuncio himſelf left two Capucins of his houſhold at <hi>Cleves,</hi> and ſuffered them not to come until he was aſſured that they ſhould enjoy a full liberty.</p>
               <p>Don <hi>Paolo Spinola Doria, Marqueſs de los Balbaſes,</hi> firſt Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the 4th of <hi>June;</hi> and ſeeing he came from <hi>Germany,</hi> he took paſſage down the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as the Nuncio had done. That Ambaſſador is a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Grandchild to the great <hi>Spinola;</hi> he hath been General of the Cavalry of <hi>Milain,</hi> and ſince Governour of that State for a time: He came from the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Embaſſy of <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeven years. He is a tall lean man, moſt civil, and well bred, and married the Siſter of the Conſtable of <hi>Colonna.</hi> Their eldeſt daughter is married to one <hi>Spinola,</hi> Duke of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> one of the richeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>Italy,</hi> and who lived at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> until the concluſion of the Treaty. This Ambaſſador had another Daughter with him, married by Proxy to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Quintana,</hi> Son to the Preſident of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi> He had likewiſe an only Son ten years old, who was called Duke of <hi>Seſto.</hi> This
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39415:38"/>great Family made a very numerous Train; yet among ſo many ſervants, there were not above five or ſix native <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors came to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> finding that the Catholicks, though under the Dioceſs of the Biſhop of <hi>Ruremond,</hi> followed the old ſtile, according to the practice of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved likewiſe to conform to it. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the Countrey have a diſpenſation ſo to do, to the end they may celebrate <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and the chief Feſtivals of the year, at the ſame time the Proteſtants do, and not appear ſingular in a Countrey where they are with much pain and difficulty ſuffered. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors followed the ſame ſtile, that they might not ſeeem to make a kind of Schiſm betwixt themſelves and the Catholicks of the Town, and that their Chappel where five or ſix Maſſes were ſaid a day, might ſerve for the devotion of the Catholick people.</p>
               <p>The Imperial and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors did not at firſt conform to that ſtile; but the Nuncio reſolved at <hi>Cologn</hi> to follow it, and even kept the Rogations at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> according to that cuſtom. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs next day about ten of the clock at night, he ſent to acquaint the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, That he was to obſerve the New
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39415:38"/>Stile, according to which the next day was the Vigil of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> The Ambaſſadors ſent the Nuncio back word, That having taken the Old Stile upon very preſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and particularly that they might conform themſelves to the Orders of the Biſhop to whom the Catholicks of the place were ſubject, they could not leave it off. The Nuncio made anſwer, That it was not his intention to oblige any body, and that what he did concerned only his own Family. Nevertheleſs he altered his opinion eight days after. The <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, and all the Miniſters of the Catholick Princes, followed the example of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, and all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels obſerved only one ſtile.</p>
               <p>At that time the Nuncio rendered his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of ceremony to the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors on one and the ſame day. The <hi>French</hi> met at the houſe of the Marſhal <hi>D' Eſtrades</hi> to receive him, reſting ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ſingle viſit, inſtead of having each of them one, as the Nuncio offer'd, though he afterward ſaw them ſeverally. His Train made a great ſhow; he had three Coaches with ſix horſes, and many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in Livery, cloathed after the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, with hanging ſleeves, ſome laced all over, and others of Velvet with long cloaks.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39415:39"/>But all the other Ambaſſadors had their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage after the <hi>French</hi> Mode.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Barclay</hi> having at that time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave to return to <hi>England</hi> by reaſon of his age and indiſpoſition, parted from <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the fifth of <hi>June.</hi> The truth is, the Negotiation was at ſuch a ſtand, that there was no diſcourſe of any affairs then, and both Mediators and Ambaſſadors had time to play. At the ſame time news came from <hi>England,</hi> that the Parliament being aſſembled the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> had made a preſſing Addreſs to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to incline him to make a League offenſive and defenſive with the States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> for oppoſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>The King was diſpleaſed at this Addreſs, and made them anſwer, <q>That it did invade ſo eſſential a Prerogative of the Crown, that the like had never been done but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Civil Wars. That it did not belong to the Parliament to preſcribe to him what kind of Leagues, and far leſs with whom he ſhould make them. That it ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould engage in it by their permiſſion, than at their ſollicitation. That foreign Princes might have cauſe to doubt whether the Soveraignty was in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and refuſe to treat for the future with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39415:39"/>a King that had only the bare name. In a word, that he could not ſuffer that prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to be invaded, which no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould ever make him to renounce, ſeeing it was the foundation of the Crown and Government.</q> And hereupon he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Parliament without having obtained from them the Supplies he demanded for procuring the ſatisfaction and ſafety of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 23. the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who deſired to begin to appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſent on his own and Colleagues parts to compliment all the Ambaſſadors of the Princes; but the <hi>French</hi> received and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them the firſt of all. The ſubſtance of the compliment that was made to every Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in particular, by a Gentleman ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two others, was, That the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> upon their arrival at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> ſent to ſalute their Excellencies, to teſtifie the joy they had to find themſelves in ſo illuſtrious an Aſſembly, and to have occaſion of treating with perſons of ſo known worth as their Excellencies were; and that his Maſter impatiently expected that his Colleagues were in a condition to be treated according to their character, that he might come in perſon to teſtifie his joy to their Excellencies.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:39415:40"/>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> gave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to underſtand, that <hi>Don Pedro de Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillo,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chriſtin,</hi> had not as yet the quality of Ambaſſadors; but it was known that the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent to the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> Plenary Commiſſions in divers forms, and left to the Marqueſs his diſpoſal the characters that he pleaſed to give them; but he being no Native <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and being to treat about an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſo great importance for <hi>Spain,</hi> which he well foreſaw would not prove advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for that Crown, it was his intereſt, as well as the dignity of his Embaſſy, that the Court ſhould authoriſe his Colleagues, that the event might be the leſs laid at his dore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſent three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to return his compliment in the like terms of eſteem and civility, whom that Ambaſſador anſwered in <hi>French.</hi> The ſame Gentlemen had Orders alſo to go wait upon the two other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, and to compliment them apart. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt before inſinuated, that they had not as yet the character, thoſe Gentlemen were advertiſed not to give them the title of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence;</hi> and for that reaſon <hi>Din Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> was not at home, thô they went twice to his houſe, and at dinner-time. But Mr. <hi>Chriſtin</hi> received the compliment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt difficulty.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:39415:40"/>
               <p>The Nuncio made no doubt but that if in the firſt ſteps that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> made, there happened any thing that might give diſcontent to the <hi>French,</hi> the Treaty might thereby receive great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; and therefore for preventing the ſame inconveniences to which the conduct of the Imperial Ambaſſadors towards the <hi>French</hi> had given occaſion; he ſo ordered m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tes, that the carriage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould give the <hi>French</hi> no cauſe to complain. So that that Mediator, extremely zealous for the repoſe of Chriſtendom, hoped that by bringing the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters to a good and familiar correſpondence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the affairs of the Peace would the more ſucceſsfully be promoted.</p>
               <p>Though the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill <hi>incognito,</hi> yet the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſent to compliment my Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, and to deſire audience of her. They viſited her ſeparately, and without much ceremony; and ſo did all the other Ambaſſadors and their Ladies, expecting till they could render her their publick Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits.</p>
               <p>Of all the Ambaſſadors Ladies that were at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Balba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was the only Lady that ſpoke not <hi>French;</hi> but ſeeing ſhe underſtood a little
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39415:41"/>of it, and that the other Ladies had no great difficulty to underſtand <hi>Italian</hi> from converſation and play, they had no need of any Interpreter.</p>
               <p>The progreſs that the <hi>French</hi> Tongue had made in foreign Countreys, appeared at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> for there was no Ambaſſadors houſe where it was not almoſt as common as their Mother-tongue. Beſides, it became ſo neceſſary, that the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, Denmark,</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, held all their Conferences in <hi>French.</hi> The two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors agreed, that even their common Diſpatches ſhould be made in that tongue, becauſe Count <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>Oldembourg</hi> ſpoke good <hi>High Dutch,</hi> but not a word of <hi>Danes,</hi> which his Collegue did. Inſomuch that during the whole courſe of the Treaty of Peace, nothing hardly but <hi>French</hi> Writings appeared, ſtrangers chuſing rather to expreſs themſelves in <hi>French</hi> in their publick ceremonies, than to write in a language that was not ſo much in uſe as it.</p>

               <p>On the 16. the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> returned from <hi>Holland,</hi> not well ſatisfied with the people of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> from whom he received not that favourable reception which he expected, by reaſon of an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that people had, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> for their own particular intereſts were the only cauſe of the continuance of the War.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lkens,</hi> Envoy from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Gottorp,</hi> a Prince in League with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and who hath been diſpoſſeſſed of his Territories by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> rendered his firſt Viſits to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors on the third of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and the ſame day the Count of <hi>Kinski</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stratman</hi> the Imperial Ambaſſadors, viſited publickly the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain,</hi> who returned the Viſit the ſame day.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio ought to have been diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at thoſe publick Viſits made before the performance of that which was due to him,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39415:43"/>as Mediator and Nuncio of the Pope; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors declared, that at the very inſtant that the civility which was due to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, was not rendered to them, and that the Ambaſſadors of that Crown ſuffered thoſe of the Emperour to have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, they would likewiſe re-aſſume the rank which they pretended to be their due, without any reſpect to the Mediation: Wherefore the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> gave in writing to the Nuncio, and wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> declaring in both, that they followed a cuſtom eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two branches of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which rendered theſe Viſits becauſe of kindred; and that theſe Viſits made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the notification of arrival, were not of any conſequence.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio and Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins</hi> gave Copies of thoſe Declarations to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and inſerted them in the Memoirs of the Mediation.</p>
               <p>On the fourth, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> having given notice of their arrival, were viſited by the Nuncio; Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> who was then the ſole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediator rendered them his Viſit immediately after and next were the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors all three together with their uſual attendance
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39415:43"/>The Ambaſſodor of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who always ſtrove not to be the laſt, had his audience the ſame evening, and all the other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors viſited them next day.</p>
               <p>Seeing C. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Oldenbourg</hi> was not come to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> though his houſe had been kept long in readineſs for him, Mr. <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kum</hi> ſtept into Office, he took the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Envoy of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and in that quality viſited all the Ambaſſadors, which he retained during the whole courſe of the Treaty, having ſigned the Memoirs that were given in by the Ambaſſador of his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then it was that the Conſultations which were held at <hi>Weſel</hi> began to break out. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who during the whole courſe of this War ſeemed always to have great deſigns, marched with the forces of <hi>Holland, Spain, Zell</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> which he commanded, to inveſt <hi>Charleroy,</hi> where he made his Lines, and aſſigned his Quarters. Several <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen came and offered their ſervice to the Prince, who ſeeing no Army in readineſs, promiſed himſelf better ſucceſs in that Siege than he had had the firſt time that he attempted it. But he was out in his meaſures; for <hi>Monſieur de Louvois</hi> who foreſaw the deſign, in a few days put a powerful Army into the field, and was himſelf in perſon in a poſture of coming to action. Many Gentlemen of the Court went thither by Poſt; and many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were there alſo to ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that occaſion; in ſo much that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeeing his hopes eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, thought fit to draw off on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having advice thereof, left <hi>Mouſon</hi> the ſame day, and marched in haſte beyond <hi>Treves</hi> During
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39415:45"/>the whole time that that Prince encamped on the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Mareſhal de Crequi</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo cloſe, and ſo incommoded him, that without fighting he ruined his Army. In effect ſince that time the Imperial Army appeared only on the defenſive.</p>
               <p>About this time the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> the dignity of that Prelate, whom his Servants without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony called my Lord the Prince, and the quality of chief of the Imperial Embaſſy, gave him without contradiction, the firſt rank among the Miniſters of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſtantly viſited him, and he returned the viſit the ſame day; but he was obliged to give the Mediators and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors a Declaration in the ſame form, as thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> gave when they viſited the Imperial Ambaſſadors, to the end that that particular cuſtom might be ſtill without prejudice to the honour that the other Ambaſſadors rendered the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, and to the preference which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 1677, that Prelate gave notice of his arrival to the Mediators and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors on the third of <hi>September.</hi> The Nuncio and Ambaſſadour <hi>Jenkins</hi> viſited him in the morning, and the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours having ſent three Gentlemen to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39415:45"/>demand Audience, rendered him their viſit at three of the Clock afternoon, with a ſplendid train of Coaches which marched in this order. The three firſt were filled with Gentlemen, the three Coaches of the body followed, the Ambaſſadors being in the laſt, and a ſeventh Coach belonging to the <hi>Mareſhal d' Eſtrades</hi> came laſt of all. All the other Ambaſſadors almoſt, rendered their Viſits the ſame day to the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck,</hi> who next day viſited the Nuncio, and Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins</hi> in the morning, and after dinner was with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who received him all three together at the houſe of the <hi>Mareſhal d' Eſtrades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop and Prince of <hi>Gurck,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baron of <hi>Goes,</hi> had the reputation of a great Negotiator, ſeeing the dignity to which he was raiſed, was the reward of the ſervices which he had rendered the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in ſeveral Negotiations; but when it was perceived that his Talent lay only in making long and rambling ſpeeches, ſtuffed with an infinite number of Queſtions, and remote Suppoſitions, which tended only to pump thoſe with whom he diſcourſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever ſpeaking his thoughts clearly, the able Miniſters were ſoon weary of his long Viſits, which laſted always three hours at leaſt. He ſeemed ſo irreſolute in the moſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39415:46"/>preſſing conjunctures, that that was no ſmall obſtacle to the concluſion of the peace of the Empire. There was never any good underſtanding betwixt him and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league the Count of <hi>Kinski,</hi> nor the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de los Balbaſes.</hi> His allowance was 3400 <hi>German</hi> Florins a Month, and he had always ſeveral perſons of Quality in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Oldembourg</hi> arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> on the ſeventh of <hi>September;</hi> but as he was preparing to give the Mediators and all the other Ambaſſadors notice of his arrival, the Imperial Miniſters acquainted him that they expected to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators. That Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor perceiving this to be contrary to the cuſtom that was eſtabliſhed at <hi>Cologn,</hi> would not conſent to the Imperial pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He well foreſaw that not only the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators would not have admitted his Viſit, but likewiſe the <hi>French</hi> and all the other Ambaſſadors who maintained the honour of the Mediation; and therefore he gave no notice of his arrival, gave nor received no Viſit, and continued ſtill <hi>incognito</hi> at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen;</hi> but that hindered not but that he met at conferences, and eſpecially at all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they played.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:39415:46"/>
               <p>That Count is the Natural Son of the laſt Count of that name; to whom the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was heir, as being of the ſame family; but the preſent Count hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a vaſt Eſtate from his Majeſty, with the Government of the County of <hi>Oldembourg;</hi> he is of the Order of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſome; his preſence, courage, rich equipage, and vaſt expence ſhewed him to be a great perſon; but his civility and free humour made him beloved of every body; inſomuch that the Aſſembly of <hi>Nimueguen</hi> loſt much by his departure, which was eight months after his arrival.</p>
               <p>The end of the Campagn drawing now near, the Confederates did not think that the <hi>French</hi> forces would effect any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Enterprize. Nevertheleſs the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> aſſured the King that he would make him Maſter of <hi>Fribourg,</hi> if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty pleaſed. The deſign appeared extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult. But the Mareſhal having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion, and all that was neceſſary for carrying on ſo great an Enterprize, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> believe that he intended ſome deſign upon <hi>Sarbruck,</hi> and at the ſame time made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body of men paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Briſac,</hi> which on the ninth of <hi>October</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <hi>Fribourg,</hi> and marching thither in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39415:47"/>great haſte, he forced the place to render, before that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> could come in time to relieve it.</p>

                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 1677, ſuch was the conſternation at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> among the <hi>Germans,</hi> and all the Miniſters of the Confederates, that even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of that place, they could hardly believe that the Mareſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> durſt have undertaken the ſiege. <hi>Fribourg</hi> has a Cittadel ſtrong by ſituation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; the Town is great and well peopled, becauſe of the Univerſity that is there, and the Emperour received a very conſiderable revenue from it; but the conſequence of that conqueſt was better known afterwards than at that time.</p>
               <p>The Voyage that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was preparing to make into <hi>England,</hi> gave ground of various conjectures. On the 17 of <hi>Octob.</hi> he Embarked at the <hi>Brill,</hi> being accompanied with the chief of his Family, and the <hi>Heer Odyke</hi> the Extraordinary Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of the States-General, who had not, as it was given out, given him a full power to conclude a Peace, or make a new League. On the 19th. the Prince arrived in <hi>England,</hi> where his Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> Eldeſt Daughter to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39415:47"/>carried on ſo ſecretly, that the firſt news that they had of it at Court was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion thereof.</p>
               <p>The news of this Marriage came to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> the 29th. and ſeeing all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates began to hope more than ever, that <hi>England</hi> would not be long before it declared in their favours, they made no more doubt of it after this Marriage. And therefore all the Miniſters of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates complimented thereupon Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins,</hi> and my Lady <hi>Temple</hi> alſo, who remained at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> after the departure of her Husband, of which no man doubted but that the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was the cauſe, whereof till then they were ignorant.</p>
               <p>The affairs of the North went daily worſe and worſe for the <hi>Suedes,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Pomerania; Stetin</hi> was beſieged from the beginning of Summer, and was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtraitned. The <hi>Danes</hi> had taken the Iſle of <hi>Rugen.</hi> And though Count <hi>Koningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> routed them there, and beat them wholly out of it, yet the Town of <hi>Stetin</hi> deprived of all kind of relief, and out of hopes of receiving any, was at length for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to render to the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> having given demonſtrations of great Lovalty to <hi>Sueden,</hi> and left to poſterity an

               <p>Affairs were wholly at a ſtand at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen;</hi> there was no meeting but for Play, Dancing and Collations, at the houſes of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France, Spain, Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> but the League which was ſigned at the <hi>Hague</hi> the tenth of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1677/8;, betwixt <hi>England</hi> and the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to oblige the <hi>French</hi> King to make Peace on the terms they had agreed upon, made all the Confederates hope that the countenance of affairs would quickly change to their advantage, and that <hi>France</hi> would be at length forced to ſtoop, or be overpowred by the multitude of enemies.</p>

                  <hi>England</hi> in effect ſeemed inclined to an open declaration, and the King thought it not ſit any longer to reject the ſollicitations of his Parliament; wherefore he made a Speech to them in a quite different ſtrain from that which was mentioned before; he acquainted the two Houſes with the League that he had made with the States-General for the preſervation of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging thoſe to a Peace who would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the conditions that they had judged reaſonable. He laid before them the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of money for compaſſing thoſe great
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39415:48"/>deſigns. He gave them ſome account of the moneys which he had received for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and equipping of Ships; and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Supplies which the Parliament did give upon this occaſion ſhould be laid out by ſuch perſons as they ſhould nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

               <p>For preſerving ſo much happy ſucceſs, it was neceſſary that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be ſtill proſperous; and that by breaking the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Confederates, they might make their Ambaſſadors change their tone. The taking of the Iſle of <hi>Tobago,</hi> of all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that were in that Port, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which was in the fort; the death of <hi>Binkes</hi> Admiral of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin of that Colony, were ſenſible blows to the States-General; as the taking of St. <hi>Guillain</hi> during the rigor of Froſt and Snow had terrified the <hi>Low-countries.</hi> By theſe means the <hi>French</hi> King thought he might overthrow the projects of his Enemies.</p>

The beſieged to no purpoſe cut their Dikes, and drowned part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for the King lodged his forces, and preſſed ſo vigorouſly the ſiege, that in a few days the Town and Cittadel were both carried.</p>
               <p>It is hard to be expreſſed what trouble the taking of <hi>Ghent</hi> put all <hi>Holland</hi> into: They ſaw to their aſtoniſhment that the <hi>French</hi> who were remote on the one ſide, approached on the other. At <hi>London</hi> all the Confederates exaggerated the importance of that loſs, that they might excite <hi>England</hi> to a ſpeedy and open declaration; whilſt the <hi>French</hi> King purſuing his conqueſts, cauſed <hi>Ypres</hi> to be beſieged on the 15 of <hi>March,</hi> and in a few days took it, though the Gariſon made a brave reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Treaty was now more than ever damped at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> ſo great proſperities

The ſame proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities had great impreſſions on <hi>Holland;</hi> the people tired out with the War, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed by the conqueſts that were made on their frontiers, minded nothing but peace. They reflected on the flouriſhing condition that the United Provinces were in before the War; they ſaw their Treaſure exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the inhabitants unable any longer to ſupport the great Impoſitions and Taxes of the Two hundred peny, which had been raiſed ſeven times in one year. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> preſſingly urged the Ambaſſadors of the Confederates, being vexed to ſee them ſtill flatter themſelves with vain hopes, when the only refuge they now had was the declaration of <hi>England;</hi> and indeed that was the thing they wholly applied themſelves to, without advancing one ſtep towards the peace.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oliver Krantz,</hi> who the year before went into <hi>Suedeland</hi> to receive new Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the King his Maſter, with whom the <hi>Danes</hi> hindered the commerce of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was come back to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> where he found affairs as backward as when he parted from thence; and beſides a great drineſs betwixt his Colleague and the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:39415:50"/>Ambaſſadors, by reaſon of a difference that had happened between the Counteſs of <hi>Oxenſtierne</hi> and Madam <hi>Colbert;</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs after her Lving-in having been pleaſed to render her firſt viſit to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Lady.</p>
               <p>That procedure offended Madam <hi>Colbert,</hi> who twice afterward refuſed the viſit of my Lady <hi>Oxenſtierne,</hi> upon pretext of feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indiſpoſitions, which hinder'd her not at the ſame time to receive the viſits of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Ladies. This publiſhed the ground of the difference, which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been adjuſted, had it happened between perſons of other humours, of whom the gravity of the one, and the frank humour of the other would hardly agree together. And that was the reaſon that the difference of thoſe two Ladies, and the drineſs betwixt the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, and the firſt Ambaſſador of <hi>Sueden,</hi> laſted even till the end of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Tragical death of the Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Ladies brother, was alſo the cauſe that that Lady viſited my Lady <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtierne</hi> no more.

                  <hi>Europe</hi> by the Propoſitions that he made the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> wherein he declared the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on which he was willing to make peace with all thoſe with whom he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in War; and whereupon his Majeſty fixed as the laſt point he would condeſcend to, and upon which his Enemies might chuſe Peace or War, provided they did it before the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> beyond which time he would not be engaged to ſtand to thoſe conditions.</p>
               <p>I will not here inſert a particular relation of theſe conditions, neither of the Memoirs of the Treaty, nor of the Treaties that were concluded, becauſe they have been already publiſhed: I ſhall only ſay, that the Propoſitions of the 9th of <hi>April</hi> were the beginning of the Negotiation of peace, and the ſcantling according to which all the Treaties have been concluded and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though at firſt nothing appeared more remote from it, nor yet afterward, until the day that the conditions were in general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts of all others ſeemed the leaſt inclined to yeild to thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The firſt which required full ſatisfaction to be made to <hi>Sueden,</hi> was inſupportable to the Northern Princes. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:39415:52"/>and other Confederates found them ſo hard, that (as they ſaid) they would hazard all, rather than accept of them: And when the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors carried theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to my Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins</hi> to be by him communicated to the Confederates, he made anſwer, That he could not do it as Mediator; but that he would acquaint them with them in diſcourſe, as a matter to which he promiſed no anſwer.</p>
               <p>That Mediator refuſed to treat on theſe Conditions, becauſe in the League that on the 10th of <hi>January</hi> was concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the King his Maſter had made other conditions with the <hi>States-General,</hi> to which they reſolved to force <hi>France.</hi> But he did not foreſee, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to preſent the <hi>French</hi> Kings Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Confederates, which would prove the cauſe of as many treaties as there were Princes and States engaged in the War; he excluded himſelf in effect from the Mediation.</p>
               <p>The news came about that time, that the <hi>French</hi> had abandoned <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and all their Conqueſts in <hi>Sicily.</hi> People were ſtrangely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:39415:52"/>gone thither to fetch off the Forces that the King had there. The abandoning of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> was imputed to the ſuſpition that the <hi>French</hi> had of <hi>England</hi>'s declaring, where conſiderable Levies were already making. Some wondered that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould ſo eaſily abandon a Countrey, the yeilding up of which might have ſtood him in ſtead in the Treaty of Peace with <hi>Spain:</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the contrary thought it more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for him ſo to recall the ſuccour which he was pleaſed to give the <hi>Meſſineſes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having had any hand in their revolt, than to forſake by a Treaty, people that had implored his protection.</p>
               <p>It was not to be doubted, but that the preſent juncture of affairs would oblige the King to provide againſt all accidents; and therefore the <hi>Marſhal de la Favillade,</hi> having declared to the Senate his Majeſties Orders, grounded on the need that he ſtood in of all his Forces, cauſed his Troops to embark. But many of the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> dreading the certain revenge of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> came in ſo great number on board of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, that if there had been more ſhips there, <hi>Meſſina</hi> had been wholly diſſerted.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>The Confederates had their eyes fixed ſolely upon <hi>England,</hi> as the only place from

                  <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo,</hi> who paſſed for one of the ſharpeſt ſighted men that was in all that famous Aſſembly, could not forbear to tell a French Gentleman, upon occaſion of the conditions of Peace which the French King had propoſed, That he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the prudence of that great Prince, and that the ſucceſs of his conduct would well appear by the neceſſity they were like to be brought to, either of making peace, or of maintaining the War alone.

                  <hi>Sueden</hi> from the low condition into which it was ſunk.</p>
               <p>Thus from all parts came bellows to blow the fire that was kindling in <hi>England,</hi> and which already threatned <hi>France.</hi> In the mean time the Parliament that was then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, was prorogued until the 9th of <hi>May;</hi> and in the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which were at that time met, the Towns were divided as to the continuation of the War.

                  <hi>May,</hi> 1678. The Province of <hi>Holland</hi> being the moſt conſiderable of all the reſt, always turns the balance of deliberations; ſo that Deputies were ſent to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to repreſent the impoſſibility that the <hi>States-General</hi> were in of continuing the War. And it appears by the three print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Memoirs of the Heers <hi>Boreel</hi> and <hi>Weede,</hi> the Extraordinary Deputies of the States to the Duke of <hi>Villa Hermoſa,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> of the 8.14. and 27. of <hi>May,</hi> that the reaſons of that impoſſibility were no leſs founded on the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39415:54"/>power and ſtrength of <hi>France,</hi> than on the weakneſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the unprofitableneſs of all their efforts. At that time there began to be ſome hopes of Peace, what averſion ſoever all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Confederates ſeemed to have to it. The time prefixed by the King was near at hand; and on the fifth of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors received orders to declare that his Majeſty required that the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> who were come for refuge into <hi>France,</hi> ſhould by the Treaty of Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> be reſtored to, and maintained in the poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, and that they might diſpoſe of them at their pleaſure. The Ambaſſadors were enjoined to inſiſt upon that point, as a matter that his Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned himſelf much in; but that demand being made after that the conditions were propoſed, it could not create an obſtacle ſufficient to hinder the concluſion of the Peace: Nevertheleſs it afterward produced a very conſiderable difficulty, ſeeing it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long after the ſigning of the Treaty, and was one of the cauſes that were alledged of the long delay that <hi>Spain</hi> made in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing the ratifications.</p>
               <p>Though it was no new thing to hear of the ſucceſs of the <hi>French</hi> forces, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men were ſtrangely ſurprized at the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:39415:54"/>news which a Courier brought from <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi> that on the ſixth of <hi>May</hi> a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Gariſon commanded by the <hi>Sieur de la Breteche,</hi> had ſurprized the fort of <hi>Leew,</hi> ſituated in a Marſh, with a double Ditch well palliſado'd. The barrels of Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth which were prepared at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> for the Execution of that Enterprize, had not the ſucceſs that was expected; but forty ſwimmers joining valour to ſtratagem, had the greateſt ſhare in that fortunate exploit; in ſo much that in an hours time the <hi>French</hi> were maſters of a very ſtrong place, and very eaſie to be maintained.</p>
               <p>The States-General in the mean time began ſeriouſly to reflect on the advantage of making Peace upon the conditions which the <hi>French</hi> King had offered them. The Town of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which has the ſame eſteem amongſt the Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> that Province has among the other ſix, was of that opinion, and backt it vigorouſly; that Town hath always been more inclined to peace than any other, not only becauſe it ſuffered more by the interruption of commerce, but alſo becauſe it hath been more tender of its liberty, having Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates diſintereſted and zealous for the Commonwealth.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:39415:55"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rotterdam</hi> had its advantage by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the War, becauſe there being but little or no Trade at that time in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but what came by means of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> all was brought to that Port, as to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Province, and the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place for them. Nevertheleſs one of the moſt conſiderable Magiſtrates of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> ſo powerfully aſſiſted thoſe that were well affected towards the Peace, that they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt all the voices of <hi>Holland.</hi> The reſt of the Provinces have found it always to be ſo much their intereſt to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that Province in matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt importance; that they ſtill acknowledg that they owe their laſt preſervation to its prudent conduct. The Provinces of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricht</hi> and <hi>Overyſſel,</hi> in which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has acquired a great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſince the <hi>French</hi> King forſook his Conqueſts there, durſt not openly declare for peace, becauſe it evidently appeared to be contrary to the intereſts of that Prince; but they referred themſelves to what <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould think fit to be done concerning that great affair.</p>
               <p>The effect of all theſe Declarations was, That the <hi>Hier Beverning</hi> received orders from the States-General, ſecretly to acquaint the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, that they accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39415:55"/>the conditions which that King was pleaſed to grant to them. This Ambaſſador, that he might act according to the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Superiors, who would not allarm their Allies, gave the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he earneſtly deſired to diſcourſe with him in private; and that for that end, he would fetch a walk alone upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Town about ſeven a Clock in the morning, becauſe at that time no body would be there. The Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be there, and had an hours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, after which he gave his Colleagues an account of the reſult of that diſcourſe, which gave occaſion to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches whereby the King was informed of the good diſpoſition of the States General; in conſideration whereof his Majeſty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ten days longer than the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> as they had deſired, that during that time they might endeavour to perſwade their Allies to accept of the conditions propoſed, as themſelves had done.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Fuentes</hi> arrived at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> the ſixth of <hi>May,</hi> he is Son to the Ambaſſador of the ſame name, who was in <hi>France</hi> after the Kings Marriage; he came from <hi>Venice,</hi> where he had reſided Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor thirteen years; and the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> called him thence, that they might employ
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39415:56"/>him in <hi>England;</hi> but it was believed that the nature of thoſe important affairs which were then treating at <hi>London,</hi> was the cauſe why the Duke of <hi>Villa Hermoſa</hi> detained him at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that he might ſend him to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> there to fill the place of ſecond Ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>The Peace began to be ſo certain in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the joy of the people appeared in all places, who at the <hi>Hague</hi> expreſſed the ſame by ſhouting, <hi>God ſave the States-General, and the Prince of Orange, the Peace is concluded.</hi> It was not ſo at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> where the Confederates were troubled; becauſe they ſaw the effect which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions offered by the <hi>French</hi> King were like to produce. They declared to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, That it was impoſſible an affair of ſo great importance, as that of the Peace, could be reſolved and concluded in ſo ſhort a time as the <hi>French</hi> King had prefixed.</p>
               <p>On the 20 of <hi>May</hi> a Courier brought to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> a copy of the Letter which the <hi>French</hi> King wrote to the States-General from the Camp at St. <hi>Denis.</hi> The 18th the King acquainted them, that with pleaſure he was informed, that they had ſentiments conform to the ſincere deſire which he had of contributing all that could conduce to the eſtabliſhing of Peace, whilſt he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39415:56"/>the advantages that his Arms had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to him, and which he might ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the ſequel of the War. By the ſame Letter the King granted to the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the ſeventh Article of the Treaty of Commerce, about which the Ambaſſadors had not agreed at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> and that he might fully remove the apprehenſions they were in of the loſs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty promiſed, That ſo ſoon as by a Treaty concluded upon the conditions propoſed, they ſhould return to his ancient Alliance, and oblige themſelves to be Neutral during the courſe of the War; he would ſtill in conſideration of them, grant the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that in the mean time he ſhould not attack any place in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> but that he ſhould always be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to grant them that <hi>Barriere</hi> which they judged ſo neceſſary for their repoſe. That if they thought fit to ſend Deputies unto him, they ſhould find him in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Ghent</hi> until the twenty-ſeventh of that Month.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as that Letter came to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> went with two Coaches and all his Retinue, to give the <hi>Dutch</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors notice of the ſame. The noiſe of this Letter, and that publick viſit, which much rejoiced the people, gave an alarm to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39415:57"/>the Miniſters of the Confederates. Every one of them diſpatched Couriers the ſame day, clearly perceiving that the conduct of the <hi>French</hi> would infallibly produce the effect which his Majeſty expected from the States-General. This beginning of Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation gave ſo large a ſubject to the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Confederates, that the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which for a long time they had held, were at that time doubled.</p>
               <p>That Letter of the <hi>French</hi> Kings was the ſame day brought to the States-General by a Trumpeter whom his Majeſty ſent to the <hi>Hague;</hi> and was there received with all the demonſtrations of joy. The States after four days conſultation, on the 25th ſent their Anſwer by one of their Trumpeters, whom the Kings Trumpeter conducted to the Camp.</p>
               <p>They expreſſed in few words the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect wherewith they had received the Letter, which his Majeſty had done them the honour to write to them, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified the exceeding joy which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſincere deſire that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had of contributing to the peace of <hi>Europe;</hi> humbly beſeeching him to give credit to the <hi>Hier Beverning</hi> their Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſador, whom they would ſend to his Majeſty, to inform him how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:39415:57"/>they were of giving him freſh aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of their ſincere intentions for the Peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors having on the 26th received a copy of the anſwer of the States-General, gave it to the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who ſent it to the King by the ſame Courier, who brought the copy of his Majeſties Letter to <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> his Majeſty was well ſatisfied to find therein, that the States-General fully correſponded with the inclination that he had for the Peace. At the ſame time the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to go within a few days and wait upon the King, that he might be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly informed of his Majeſties intentions. That Ambaſſador would willingly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed himſelf; but the States Order being renewed, on the 29th he ſet out from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> in Laid-coaches. The reluctancy of the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> was attributed to the fear he had of diſobliging the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whoſe Intereſts did not admit of the Peace; till that time this Ambaſſador was reputed a very good <hi>Republican;</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was thought wedded to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> though it could not be affirmed whether fear or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were the cauſe of that engagement. He is a man of a penetrating wit, who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:39415:58"/>knows what is good, and always purſues it by juſt means. He is aſſiduous and painful, and hath been employed by the States in many Embaſſies, and in all the Treaties that have been made ſince the year 1650; but he loves retirement, and it was not without trouble that he left his Country-houſe near <hi>Leyden,</hi> to come to <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> The <hi>Heer Haren</hi> his Colleague is a Gentleman of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> of much credit in that Province, and addicted to the intereſts of the Prince of <hi>Naſſan,</hi> Governour and Hereditary State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the Provinces of <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Groninguen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> arrived on the 30th at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and there found a Trumpeter, who ſtayed for him to conduct him to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, where having ſeen Monſieur <hi>de Pompone,</hi> he had Audience of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty: He found him ſo ſincere in his intentions towards the Peace, and ſo favourably inclined towards the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that on the firſt of <hi>June</hi> he left the Camp; but in the account that he gave his Superiors of his Negotiation, he told them that he found the <hi>French</hi> King as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the condition of his enemies, and of the places that he might attack, as he was of his own affairs.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:39415:58"/>
               <p>About the ſame time the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> gave notice of his arrival to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors; but ſeeing he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready viſited thoſe of the Emperour in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, without giving the ſame declaration that his Colleagues had given to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to whom all the Ambaſſadors gave the precedency, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Gentleman to tell the perſon that came from him, that they could not ſee him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he firſt performed what was due to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as Mediators. By that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors obliged Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins,</hi> to whom they had given their promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to maintain the honour of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</p>
               <p>It was alledged that it was to no purpoſe for the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> to give that particular declaration, ſince that inſtead of one which might ſuffice for the three Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>Spain,</hi> they had already given two. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that for the ſame reaſon they ought to have a third, and that no conſideration ſhould hinder the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> from following the example of his Colleagues in that matter; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they had great cauſe to wonder, that by ſuch a refuſal he would in ſome meaſure ſeem to condemn their conduct; ſo that for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:39415:59"/>want of that declaration the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors ſaw not the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> during the whole courſe of the Treaty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at the meetings of the Ladies, where he uſed to come as the other Ambaſſadors did.</p>
               <p>The news from <hi>England</hi> were at that time very tumultuary; they adviſed, that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had Prorogued the Parliament to the third of <hi>June,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing at that time to give them good news of the Peace. Seeing a Prorogation of it ſelf cuts off all that hath been propoſed and treated in preceding Seſſions without being concluded and confirmed, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation put a ſtop to ſome pert Addreſſes which the Houſe of Commons had made to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſuch as that whereby they deſired the King would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who they were that had counſelled his Majeſty to give the anſwers which he made in the mouth of <hi>May</hi> the year before, and in the Month of <hi>January</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

                  <hi>June</hi> 1678, The Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> who had not as yet communicated his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Commiſſion, cauſed on the firſt of <hi>June</hi> a copy thereof to be given, which was collationed by the Nuncio's Auditor. The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:39415:59"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors found it not to be in the form that it ought to be, becauſe all the four Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> being named therein, and being <hi>Poſteriour</hi> in date to that of the three Ambaſſadors who were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it ſeemed that by that means the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> might diſown, when they ſhould pleaſe, all that they had done till then, ſince that that new plenary commiſſion might annul the former. And therefore the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors refuſed to accept of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> ſhould have one apart, or that this laſt ſhould be of the ſame date with the former, without which they declared that they would not acknowledg him for an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they were in great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> to know what had been the ſucceſs of the deputation of the <hi>Heer Beverning,</hi> who to the trouble of the Confederates went from thence to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, not doubting but that all theſe proceedings would at length termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a Peace with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> They thought it a matter of ſo much importance to divert that blow, that for that end they ſet all engines at work; but on the fourth of <hi>June</hi> a Courier from the Camp brought the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors a copy of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39415:60"/>which that King had made to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the States-General, and another of the Memoir that his Majeſty had cauſed to be given to the <hi>Heer Beverning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King by that Letter teſtified the pleaſure which he had to ſee the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in a diſpoſition towards Peace; that his Majeſty was willing to condeſcend to ſeveral things in favour of their Allies; and how joyful he would be, by reſtoring to them his ancient amity, to enter with them into ſuch engagements as might for ever ſecure their repoſe and liberty.</p>
               <p>It can hardly be believed what good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the word <hi>Liberty</hi> produced in the minds of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> that word was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them, and ſo ſenſibly affected them, that in all the impreſſions that have been made of that Letter in <hi>Holland,</hi> the word <hi>Repoſe</hi> is left out, to make that of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> ſound the louder. They talked pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that whatever ſecret or publick ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they might have, for the future they would not fear the loſs of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> in which the preſent War had made ſo great a breach.</p>
               <p>By the Memoir given to the <hi>Heer Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King at the deſire of the States-General granted a Truce for ſix weeks, to begin the firſt of the enſuing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:39415:60"/>Month, which extended that Truce until the fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the end that the States might have all the time they wiſhed for to perſwade their Allies to conſent to the Peace, in conſideration whereof the States ſhould promiſe not to aſſiſt them in any manner, during the whole courſe of that War, if they would not incline them to embrace the conditions offered by the King; it being unjuſt that his Majeſty in the condition that his forces were in, ſhould loſe the occaſions of action, and ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf of new, as he had already done by the Letter of the 18th of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Month. But to evidence the ſincerity of his intentions, his Majeſty at the ſame time gave orders to the Mareſhal of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> General of his Army, not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack any place during all that time, and to ſtay for the anſwer of the States in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The good diſpoſition that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſeemed to be in at that time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the advancement of the Peace. The <hi>Heer Beverning,</hi> who came to the Camp from <hi>London,</hi> brought word that the King of <hi>England</hi> approved all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had made towards the Peace. And by the Harangue that his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> made to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39415:61"/>the third of <hi>June,</hi> he declared that none were to be blamed but the Houſe of Commons if he could not engage in the War. And the Chancellor told the whole Parliament that their manner of acting could not but provoke a powerful Prince, who might reſent it; and for that reaſon that they ought to ſtrengthen themſelves at home and abroad, for their own ſecurity againſt all kind of attempts.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Confederates ſet all Engines at work to incline the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to favour their intereſts. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Borgomanero,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary from <hi>Spain</hi> at that Court, on the fifth of <hi>June</hi> repreſented to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> how neceſſary it was that he ſhould ſend his Fleet and Army towards the <hi>Low-countries</hi> for a curb to the common enemy, and a Guard to all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt the oppreſſion and ruin wherewith it was threatned by the moſt Chriſtian King; and how advantageous it would be for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to make a League offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive with the Catholick King his Maſter, and the Emperour, who would prove his conſtant Allies in all the concerns of the common cauſe.</p>

               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Confederates held long and frequent conferences at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen;</hi> but they found it difficult to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon the anſwer that they were to give upon the communication which the Ambaſſadors of the States-General had made to them of the Memoir that the <hi>French</hi> King had given to the <hi>Heer Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and whereupon the Ambaſſadors urged their reſolution, that they might take their meaſures accordingly; at length all of them gave their Anſwers in their Conference of the tenth.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Ambaſſadors gave it in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and very long; but the purport of all was, that they expected from the candour and equity of the States-General, that they would do nothing to the prejudice of the Emperour, the Empire, and all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, who were only engaged in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War for the preſervation of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-Provinces,</hi> which the States themſelves knew ſufficiently, without being put in mind of it. That they had to do with an enemy whoſe deſign was only to divide the Confederates, that he might the more eaſily ſurprize them all. That if there was an abſolute neceſſity that they muſt make Peace, the Emperour offered to concur with them in it upon fair and honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39415:62"/>but that they would not take ſuch precipitate reſolutions as were demanded by the enemy. That they well perceived the deſign was only to throw them upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, ſince they were not ſo much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to treat of thoſe matters, without the deciſion of which no Peace could ever be had. That they intreated them not to be over-haſty. That the general Peace was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, if <hi>France</hi> perceived that the States-General had a deſign to treat ſeparately; aſſuring them, that when the Emperour ſhould make Peace, he would not be leſs careful of the needs of the <hi>

               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer on the ſame ſubject, That he believed that the States-General would never do any thing to the diſadvantage of his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, who had expoſed his perſon, and ſpent his revenues to comply with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements into which he had entered with them. That if they were abſolutely obliged to accept of Peace, they expected that they would not do any thing that might force thoſe whoſe affairs were in a better poſture, to accept of abſolute conditions. That it was not fit that the conſtancy which the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:39415:62"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> ſhewed to their Allies, ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the firmneſs of their Union; that they ought to guard againſt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that the leaſt precipitancy might plunge them into; and that provided the King his Maſter found his ſecurity in a Treaty, he would ſacrifice all his intereſts to the publick weal.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf that the <hi>States-General</hi> would promiſe nothing to the <hi>French</hi> King that might be contrary to the League that the Elector his Maſter had with them; ſince he had neither ſpared his Blood nor Countries, to preſerve their Republick from utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that far leſs they would conclude a Peace with <hi>France,</hi> till they firſt procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Maſter the ſatisfaction they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him by their Treaty of Alliance. That as to the reſt his Electoral Highneſs deſired nothing more than a reaſonable Peace, for procuring whereof he ſhould always make appear his moderation, and the reſpect he had to the urgent reaſons which the <hi>States-General</hi> pretended for concluding of Peace.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Confederates made all theſe Remonſtrances to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-General</hi> at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> it was known that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> declared at the <hi>Hague,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in the mean time, and all the Miniſters of the Northern Princes, exclaimed againſt the inclination that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> had to ſo diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous a Peace; they made their own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the <hi>French</hi> Kings condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſaying that <hi>France</hi> laid ſnares for them, which they could not diſcover until they were out of condition of avoiding them; or that otherwiſe there muſt needs be ſome internal weakneſs in the forces of <hi>France,</hi> how formidable ſoever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; that ſtanding of it out would do the buſineſs; and that it was too baſe to ſubmit to an abſolute Law, whilſt they were not yet out of hopes of gaining thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that would render their condition better.</p>

               <p>In the Conference of the 20th, all the Ambaſſadors of the Confederates anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but after their uſual way of biaſſing: The Biſhop of <hi>Gurck</hi> made a long ſpeech, wherein he exaggerated all that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had done and ſuffered both within and without the Empire for the defence of the <hi>States-General.</hi> He aſſured them, that it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39415:64"/>was with grief that the Emperour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they were reduced to a neceſſity of making Peace; that he found the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>France</hi> to be contrary to the rights of all Soveraign powers, in that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed conditions without admitting of Treaties; that the Emperour deſired Peace; that the Ambaſſadors of the States had themſelves acknowledged that the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were hard, and that it was not their intention that every thing therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould be ſwallowed down; that for their part, they had declared to them that the Emperour could not admit of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative of <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> in the manner it was propoſed; that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected orders from his Imperial Majeſty, and in the mean time beſought them that by their good offices they would diſpoſe the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to admit of more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conditions, and to enter into Treaty with them; and that they would incline them to have regard to their Allies, and eſpecially to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was the moſt injured of all.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> ſaid, That he had nothing to add to the laſt anſwer which the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> had given in writing to the Deputies of the <hi>States-General;</hi> and that the King his Maſter would
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39415:64"/>not abandon the intereſts of his Allies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Peace nor War. By that kind of expreſſion this Ambaſſador declared for the Peace, without offending the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſeeing his Declaration was conform to the acceptation with which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Low-countries</hi> took it in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of 27th of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi> alledged that in the ſhort time that had paſſed ſince he was required to give a peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, it was not poſſible that he could have had new orders from the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for giving it; that the matter was of ſuch importance, that no leſs depended on it than the acceptation of Peace, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of War; that as to the <hi>States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> it was to very little purpoſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them about an affair that was ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, that nothing was wanting to it but the formalities of a concluſion. That the King his Maſter had no other meaſures now to take, but to put the States in mind, that the Peace which they were about to make, did not exempt them from the obligation of their reciprocal Treaties; and that he prayed God that he would inſpire the <hi>States-General</hi> with counſels ſuitable to the reflection they ought to make on the ſtate of thoſe whom they themſelves had drawn
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:39415:65"/>into the hazards of the preſent War.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſame reaſon, to excuſe himſelf from giving the Declaration to which he was urged; ſaying that he had but two things to repreſent to the <hi>States-General;</hi> the firſt was, That though on the part of the Elector his Maſter he had given in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Peace with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden;</hi> yet his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared on what conditions he would make it. The other, That the general condition of the intire ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden</hi> being down-right contrary to that which the <hi>States-General</hi> were obliged to procure to the Elector his Maſter, it was to be thought that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden</hi> deſired not to have Peace.</p>
               <p>The Preſident Canon who was not at the Conference of the tenth, enlarged very much upon the hardneſs of the Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which the <hi>French</hi> King offered to his Maſter; ſeeing, as he ſaid, the firſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up almoſt all his Country, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the half of his Territories; and that the other by depriving him of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, and the Soveraignty of the four Ways which <hi>France</hi> demanded, took from him at the ſame time the free commerce of his own Territories. That if the faith of all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:39415:65"/>the Treaties made with the Confederates, was of no effect to his Maſter, he proteſted that that Prince would rather baniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf willingly from his own Country, than to be reſtored to it upon ſuch hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeeing he had never done any thing againſt <hi>France</hi> that could deſerve ſo ſevere uſage.</p>

               <p>All theſe high diſcourſes and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that tended to ſtave off the Peace, ſtopt not the courſe of the Negotiation. On the 22 the <hi>States-General</hi> ſent orders to their Ambaſſadors to ſign the Peace with <hi>France</hi> before the end of the Month; and they wrote the ſame day to the King by the <hi>Sieur de Launoy</hi> one of their Officers, who paſt through the Camp and delivered a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from them to the <hi>Mareſhal de Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> whereby the States acquainted that General with the Order they had given their Ambaſſadors at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> to ſign the Peace, and communicated to him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Letter which they wrote to his Majeſty upon that Subject.</p>
               <p>The Eſtates expreſſed to the King with what joy they underſtood by the anſwer of the firſt of that Month, given at his Camp at <hi>Weteren,</hi> that his Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant them a longer Truce, that they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:39415:66"/>might induce their Allies to accept of the Conditions he had propoſed; and that to give him all poſſible ſatisfaction they had omitted nothing that lay in their power. That though they could not promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that all their Allies could concur with them in that particular, yet nevertheleſs they had given Orders to their Ambaſſadors to ſign the Treaty about the end of the Month; but that ſeeing they were aſſured that his Catholick Majeſty would accept of the Peace with them, they beſought his Majeſty to put a ſtop to all acts of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to cauſe his Army to draw off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his frontiers, and to give Paſſports to the Veſſels of their ſubjects that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad a fiſhing, to ſecure them from his Majeſties men of War.</p>

In the project of the Treaty there was no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the time wherein the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:39415:66"/>King was to deliver up the places to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>States-General,</hi> being a thing not at all mentioned in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The King pretended that it was not to be done till after the General Peace, and the full ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in proſpect whereof his Majeſty condeſcended ſo much on his part. <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States-General</hi> underſtood that the reſtitution of places ought to be immediately after the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaties. Nevertheleſs the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was managed in that manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the very day before the Treaty was to be ſigned, without any thoughts of a clear explanation of that point.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> was the firſt that demanded an Explication as to the time of the reſtitution of the places. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſuſpected ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for having given occaſion to that Ambaſſador to ſtart the queſtion. However it were, the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> had no ſooner received that Umbrage, but that he went to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors to inquire their opinions on that ſubject. Theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if the <hi>French</hi> pretended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the reſtitution beyond the exchange of the ratifications, it was a thing not meant by them; and immediately they went to deſire the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to give them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:39415:67"/>their Explication, which they would ſend to the <hi>States-General</hi> by an Expreſs.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> told them, that the ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden</hi> being the firſt of the Conditions propoſed by the King their Maſter, without which his Majeſty would have declared that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to peace, it behoved that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which accepted theſe conditions ſhould contribute what in them lay, to procure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to <hi>Sueden;</hi> and that the retention of Places was the eaſieſt means, which the King had in his hands, for obtaining it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demanding that the ſame Powers who only accepted the conditions of peace, that they might ſo ſoon as they could free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the misfortunes of War, ſhould engage any other ways for procuring that ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the Reaſons that were alledged to juſtifie the conduct of the <hi>French</hi> King, the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> having received an anſwer from the <hi>States-General,</hi> declared to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors on the 25th, that he could not ſign the Peace if the King did not remit his pretenſions. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors having no power to deſiſt, it behoved them to ſtay for new Orders from the Court.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:39415:67"/>
               <p>The Miniſters of the Confederates, and all the ill affected, who with extream trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaw that the Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi> which was to be followed with that with <hi>Spain,</hi> was upon the point of being ſigned, failed not to make their beſt of that conjuncture which favoured their deſigns, and to do all they could to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſuſpect the ſincerity of <hi>France.</hi> It was the eaſier for them to ſucceed in this, that thoſe very men who in the States had been the chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the Peace, exclaimed moſt againſt that new pretention. For ſeeing they were not willing to be ſuſpected to have yielded to ſnares, wherewith they might have been ſurprized, they thought themſelves obliged to appear the moſt ſtedfaſt and moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute wholly to break off the Treaty, rather than to condeſcend to that point.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that as the generoſity of the <hi>French</hi> King towards the <hi>States-General,</hi> the amity which his Majeſty expreſſed for them in his Letters, and his condeſcenſions to a Peace with them, when they had greateſt cauſe of fear, had on the one hand intirely gained the hearts of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> ſo on the other hand the enemies of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe that envied its growth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, made ſo good uſe of that juncture, to fill the peoples minds with diſtruſt, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39415:68"/>they began in good earneſt to believe, that the <hi>French</hi> acted not ſincerely with them, and that every Article of the Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome meaning diſadvantageous to their Country.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> in the mean time declared to thoſe of the <hi>States-General</hi> on the 30th, that they were ready to ſign the Peace upon the Conditions that were ſtipulated betwixt them; and that ſeeing they had not mentioned to them the time of the reſtitution of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> until the 25th, neither could they any ſooner give their Maſter advice of the new clauſe that they would have added to the article which themſelves had framed concerning that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but that in the mean time they offered to ſign the Treaties of Peace and Commerce in the manner as was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they might make it appear to the world, that they deſired not to delay for one day the ſigning of a Peace, which all the people ſo impatiently longed for.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Spain,</hi> the ſame Ambaſſadors ſaid, That if that Crown which had not as yet openly accepted neither the Peace nor Truce, did formally declare that without delay they embraced Peace upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions propoſed, and did chuſe one of the Alternatives touching <hi>Dinant</hi> and <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:39415:68"/>it ſhould appear that the King their Maſter deſired nothing more than that Chriſtendom ſhould enjoy the repoſe which it might expect from his promiſes.</p>
               <p>During theſe Debates, the <hi>Heer Odyke</hi> ſecond Ambaſſador from the <hi>States-General,</hi> who had not hitherto ſtayed above two or three days at a time in <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> came thither with his whole family. He is of the Houſe of <hi>Naſſau</hi> by Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Grandfather to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whoſe Intereſts he is wholly devoted; and not without reaſon, for he receives many favours from him, and has a conſiderable Revenue by reaſon that being the chief of the Nobles of <hi>Zealand</hi> in place of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Nobility in the States and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of that Province. He is well bred and magnificent, loving company and pleaſures; and has a particular dexterity in inventing of them.</p>
               <p>There were ſtill ſome hopes that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which put a ſtop to the ſigning of the Peace would be taken away; but by a Courier from the <hi>French</hi> Court, who arrived <hi>July</hi> 10.1678, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ. having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Order to ſignifie to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that the King would not remit any as thing to the detention of the places, that he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39415:69"/>ſatisfaction to <hi>Sueden;</hi> one could not tell what to think of the Peace.</p>
               <p>Whilſt affairs were in this doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, news was brought to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> that on the ſixth of <hi>July</hi> there had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Bridge of <hi>Reinfield,</hi> a ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt a great Detachment of the <hi>French</hi> Army, and a like number of their enemies, who were ſo ſmartly attacked in their Trenches, and ſo briskly drove upon the Bridg, that many of them were killed and drowned, with ſome of their Generals; in ſo much that if the Bridg had not been quickly ſet on fire, the ſame thing perhaps might have befallen that Town which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>French</hi> Soldiers having entered into it pell-mell with thoſe that run.</p>
               <p>At that time the Duke of <hi>Trimouille</hi> ſent the <hi>Sieur de Sanguiniere,</hi> a Counſeller of the <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Procuration, and the Titles that juſtified the pretenſions he had to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> to the end that the ſame proteſtation might be made to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as was made to thoſe of the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> for preſervation of the rights that he has to that Kingdom, by <hi>Anne de Laval</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> from whom that Duke deſcended in right line.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:39415:69"/>The Mareſhal <hi>d' Estrades</hi> his Lady arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the 12th, and was met by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors at <hi>Moock</hi> on the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> two Leagues from thence; where ſhe diſembarked. As all the <hi>French</hi> were very curious to be preſent at that firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, ſo the people of <hi>Nimueguen</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs deſire of ſeeing that Lady. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after her arrival all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and their Ladies rendered her their publick viſits.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio about this time received a Courier from <hi>Rome;</hi> but the cauſe of his coming was not fully known. Nevertheleſs ſeeing the noiſe of the Peace was already ſpread all over <hi>Europe,</hi> it was not doubted but that that Court deſired to find ſome expedient that might remove the obſtacles which hindered the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> from admitting the facultative Brief of the Nuncio, becauſe the Pope had named none but the Emperour in it.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio offered then three over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſatisfie the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors: the firſt was, to preſent a Brief in which no Prince ſhould be named. The ſecond, to give as many Briefs as there were Chriſtian Princes in War, wherein every one might have the rank that he deſired. And the third to follow the ſtile of the plenary
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:39415:70"/>Commiſſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators, by giving a Brief facultative to end the War which was betwixt the Emperour, <hi>Spain, Holland,</hi> and their Confederates on the one ſide; and the moſt Chriſtian King, the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> and their Allies on the other. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors continued firm in their Pretenſions, and would according to the ancient cuſtom, have the King their Maſter named immediately after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and that was the reaſon why in all the Treaties of Peace that have been ſince concluded, there is no mention made of the Mediation of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of that conduct of the Nuncio, the pains he took in promoting of the peace, were as grateful to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, as they were conducive to the repoſe of Chriſtendom. That Mediator carried himſelf alſo in ſo different a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the former practice of Nuncio's, in regard of Proteſtant Princes, that it was not his fault if he did not viſit all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors that were at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> He ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the viſit to the Envoy of <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> who had viſited him; and received the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants with as much civility as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; which produced ſo good effects for the Catholick Intereſt in all theſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and correſponded ſo well with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39415:70"/>of the Pope, that on occaſion of the Bull which was then believed the Pope would emit, one of the moſt eminent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the States-General ſaid, <hi>That their Miniſters might well preach that the Pope was Antichriſt; but that for his own part he was perſuaded that this man was not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>News came on the 13. That the <hi>Mareſhal de Schomberg</hi> was advanced with Twenty thouſand men towards <hi>Duren</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Juliers;</hi> and that he had ſent to demand of the City of <hi>Cologn</hi> the forty thouſand Crowns, and twelve thouſand of Intereſt, which that Town ought to reſtore to the <hi>French</hi> King, ſeeing that contrary to the Neutrality agreed upon at the firſt Aſſembly held there for the peace, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſuffered that money to be taken by the Gariſon. The Envoy of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who was at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> demanded audience of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors; but they refuſed it, becauſe he came to the Aſſembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Paſport from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army, which encamped at the gates of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> ſo netled the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and incommoded the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that there happened ſome tumult in the Town, where <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> was accuſed for being the author of thoſe counſels that delayed the concluſion of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39415:71"/>peace; inſomuch that it was affirmed for a certain, that the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> wrote to the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes,</hi> that he would make him accountable for the loſs of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> if with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he did not conclude the peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſtill expected the laſt reſolution of the States-General, that they might ſend back the Courier which the Mareſhal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> had at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> with the news according to which he was to take his meaſures, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into action, or drawing of the Armies he was upon the point to have marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> upon the Letter of the States-General, wherein they informed him that they had given orders to their Ambaſſadors to ſign the Peace at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen:</hi> but the advice that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors gave him of the new difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which hinder'd the ſigning of it, made him to remain ſtill in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>My Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> parted for the <hi>Hague</hi> on the 14th. where finding no final reſolution for concluding the peace, if the impediment which hinder'd the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it were not removed; he beſtirred himſelf with all induſtry to incline the States-General to enter into new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the King his Maſter, that might
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39415:71"/>procure them and their Allies more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous conditions than thoſe which <hi>France</hi> propoſed to them. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors thought fit, in the mean time, to make publick the reaſons that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had to retain the places until <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had ſatisfaction; and for that end they cauſed to be printed the Memoir which on the 17th. they gave to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
               <p>By this Paper it was given out, That the <hi>French</hi> King having equally eſpouſed the Intereſts of <hi>Sueden</hi> with his own, and on that account only abandoned ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which was no leſs advantageous to the <hi>Dutch</hi> than <hi>Spaniards;</hi> his Majeſty had grounds to hope that theſe Powers would contribute with him for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Crown, or at leaſt that they would not oppoſe his deſign in making uſe of thoſe places, as of a very proper expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to procure the performance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which they agreed by accepting the peace. But ſince that the Kings Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies endeavoured to render his Majeſties word ſuſpected, he was willing to engage with the States General in all the meaſures they ſhould judg moſt convenient for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſatisfaction to <hi>Sueden.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:39415:72"/>
               <p>This Memoir being enlarged and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in way of a Manifeſto, the States-General cauſed an Anſwer containing thirty pages to be made to it by their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, which was printed in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and on the 25th given to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors.</p>
               <p>It contained a long recital of all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, whereby they alledged, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the favourable expreſſions that the King was pleaſed to uſe towards them, they could not believe that the ſentiments of his Majeſty agreed with the expreſſions of the Ambaſſadors Memoir. That they could not impute that emergent to any thing but the artifice of thoſe who for private intereſts were againſt the publick peace. That in all the Negotiation no mention being made of <hi>Sueden</hi> to them, it would be unjuſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the King having demanded a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality from the States-General as an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial condition in their ſeparate peace, they ought to give their places to be made uſe of againſt their Allies. That the States promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as they had already done, to contribute what in them lay for the accommodation of the Northern powers, by all the good offices they were capable to perform; and they proteſted that it was not their fault if the peace were not preſently brought to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concluſion.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:39415:72"/>
               <p>That Anſwer made it evidently appear, that the States-General had no deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend; and indeed they began to think of other meaſures: for their Deputies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Foreign affairs ſigned a ſecond Treaty with Ambaſſador <hi>Temple,</hi> grounded on this, That the States-General having accepted the offers of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that his Catholick Majeſty ſhould do the ſame as to what concerned him, they perceived to their grief that the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> oppoſed the peace by the refuſal of delivering up the places. That therefore they were obliged to have recourſe to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to the end that if his Mediation with the moſt Chriſtian King ſhould prove ineffectual, he would protect ſo juſt a cauſe, and aſſiſt them with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>This Treaty was ſtill conditional as to the circumſtance of time, and was not to take effect but in caſe they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the <hi>French</hi> King a Declaration fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to their pretenſions, before the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and that his Majeſty ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed to render up the places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exchange of the Ratifications. In caſe of ſuch a refuſal, they agreed with his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to declare War againſt <hi>France,</hi> that by united force they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39415:73"/>might oblige that King to embrace the conditions ſtipulated by that Treaty. Theſe conditions were far different from thoſe which the <hi>French</hi> King propoſed the 9th of <hi>April;</hi> but they were only ſpecified for the Empire, <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt that Treaty was concluding at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and that the Miniſters at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> impatiently expected to know what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would at length be taken on either ſide concerning the reſtitution of places, the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> made ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to incline them to admit of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente,</hi> that he might not have the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being come to that Aſſembly, and not have the power to ſign the Treaty of peace; but they would not conſent until that Ambaſſador produced a plenary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the ſame form with the reſt, and they were ſatisfied with a collationed copy which the Nuncio's Auditor gave them, without receiving the viſit of that Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, for the reaſon that I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> that loves to be very gallant, reſolved to treat the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Ladies after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion; but ſeeing they viſited no Ambaſſadors that wanted Ladies, they were invited in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39415:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>name of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Quintana,</hi> who did the Honours of the Feaſt. The two <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors Ladies went thither, but the Ambaſſadors excuſed themſelves, becauſe they viſited not the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente.</hi> Whether it was there, or that there had been before ſome difference betwixt the Servants of Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> which might have occaſioned ſome reſentment; it happened that this time a Lackey belonging to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> was ſomewhat ill uſed at the Gate; this Footman did the like to one of the Servants of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> the firſt time that they came to the houſe of Monſieur <hi>Colbert;</hi> in ſo much that the difference made ſuch noiſe, that the Nuncio thought fit to take cognizance of it, and to make both ſides promiſe that the matter ſhould go no further.</p>
               <p>The ſame day being the 29th, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors by a Courier-Expreſs, received Orders from Court, according to which they framed a Memoir, which they gave to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, whereby they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to them that the ſatisfaction of a King in Alliance with the King their Maſter, being the ſole end that his Majeſty propoſed to himſelf in the preſent affair of the retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Places, he would willingly admit of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39415:74"/>all Propoſitions that might tend to that end, and that for that effect he would come as far as St. <hi>Quentin,</hi> to hear what the States had to propoſe to him by Deputies, aſſuring them that they would find him ſo equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inclined, that they ſhould have no more cauſe to doubt of the ſincerity wherewith his Majeſty had begun and continued to treat with them concerning Peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors had nothing to anſwer to theſe Propoſitions; they ſaid, That they ſaw no expedient to remove that difficulty which was made about the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the places; that if the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had any, they might propoſe them; and that their Maſters did not think that a deputation upon that ſubject would be to any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed that the miſtruſt which the Ambaſſadors entertained mutually of one another, upon occaſion of the impediment that ſtopt the concluſion of the Peace, and even infected their Servants; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation that I juſt now ſpoke, which was made two days before, did not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe either party, but that on the laſt of <hi>July</hi> at night there happened amongſt them a ſcuffle of far more dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:39415:74"/>
               <p>That evening there was a great Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz at the Houſe of the <hi>Heer Odyke,</hi> and as it was on a <hi>Saturday</hi> they intended to ſtay by it, and drank to their wives. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had notice given them about ten of the Clock, that the Servants of the Duke of St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been there with Arms. They immediately acquainted the Nuncio with it, who had concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in adjuſting that Quarrel, who was not indeed wanting in giving neceſſary Orders about it: But about Eleven of the Clock at night, the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who had been the Authors of the firſt difference, went and fired ſome Piſtols a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> which made the Servants of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to provide againſt what might happen.</p>
               <p>The Company being ſet down to Table at the Houſe of the <hi>Heer Odyke,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors obſerved that all the Servants of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> were about the Table, and filled the Hall, whilſt they were without attendance according to their cuſtom, that they might not peſter the houſe they went to. This made them ſend to call all their Gentlemen to come and wait on them, to ſtand behind them, and to order their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to ſerve them. Theſe Orders preſently obeyed, ſo ſurprized the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39415:75"/>eſpecially the Ladies, that for ſome time there was not a word ſpoken at Table. The <hi>Heer Odyke</hi> thought himſelf obliged to riſe from Table, and reaſſume the Ladies by inviting them to eat; but he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er up, but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Company roſe likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The Marq. <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> with his whole Family, and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> took leave of the Company at the very inſtant, and went home in four Coaches, without telling why, or informing themſelves of the reaſon of that proceeding.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors paſſed by the Houſe of the Mareſhal <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> which was not twelve-ſcore paces diſtant from thence, where all the Livery-men belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were ſhut up, for fear of ſome diſorder, to which they were obſerved to be much inclined. Three Coaches had already paſt, when ſome of thoſe who were in the fourth with Arms, fired a Carabin at the Gate of the Mareſhal <hi>d' Eſtrades</hi> his Houſe. Perhaps they did it only in <hi>bravado,</hi> thinking they might ſafely do it, ſince they ſaw the Gate ſhut; but at this ſhot, whereof the Bullets left impreſſion on the Gate, all the Servants that were in the Houſe finding themſelves inſulted over, ſnatched up what Arms they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39415:75"/>could find, opened the Gate, and ran after the Coaches, who again firing upon them, were anſwered in the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were in the mean time in Diſcourſe with the <hi>Heer Odyke,</hi> and complained of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carriage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of their numerous attendants; but the Gentlemen who were with them, having heard the firſt ſhots, ran thither in all haſte, and coming up with thoſe Servants that were about to attack the Coaches, with much ado ſtopt them. They came certainly in the nick of time, for finding none on their ſide wounded, and none to engage with but Coaches, wherein were ſo many Ladies of quality, amongſt whom was the Dutcheſs of <hi>St. Peter</hi> ready to be brought to bed; they ſo ordered the matter by threatening their people, that the tumult went no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had cauſe of fear at that time; their Lacqueys threw away their Flamboys, and their Coachmen put to a gallop through the Market-place, and along a deſcending Street at the end whereof they lodged. The whole Town was alarmed at the noiſe of ſhot about two of the Clock in the morning. The Town-guard ſent the Court of Guard, and did not appear, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39415:76"/>all people ran to the windows. But a ſtop was put to this tumult in a trice, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many people there were none but a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coachman wounded in the foot, and a <hi>French</hi> Lacquey in the hand.</p>
               <p>The Mediators, and eſpecially the Nuncio, employed themſelves next day to compoſe that difference. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver confeſs publickly that they were the aggreſſors. Nevertheleſs ſeeing it was but a ſcuffle amongſt Servants, it was conſented to on either hand, that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes,</hi> ſhould each of them ſend to the Nuncio, and the Lord Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, with ſome Servants in Livery, to be delivered into their hands, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to cauſe what puniſhment they thought fit to be inflicted on them, for tranſgreſſing the Orders that were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their carrying of Arms. But ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had not owned the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> for an Ambaſſador, they would not ſuffer him to make any kind of ſatisfaction, though his Servants were known to have been the firſt Authors of that diſorder.</p>

                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678, this was put in execution the third of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39415:76"/>having been extreamly diſcompoſed by an accident, which they unawares expected, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſent to compliment them ſeverally.

               <p>At that time the <hi>Heer Boreel</hi> Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from the <hi>States-General</hi> arrived at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> his arrival was taken as a good preſage for the Peace of <hi>Holland;</hi> for the States, as I have ſaid, had employed him to incline the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> to accept the Conditions propoſed by the <hi>French</hi> King. And the intereſt of the Town
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:39415:77"/>of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the place of his birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dear unto him, it was not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that he was very zealous for the Peace.</p>
               <p>The Mareſhal of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> ſent at the ſame time to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> the <hi>Sieur de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart</hi> Captain of his Guards, to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation to the Mediators againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> which falling to the heir-female, ought to belong to him in right of his Wife, as he proved by her Genealogy, and by the Laws and Cuſtoms of that Dutchy.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by the copy of the Memoir which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had given to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for juſtifying the detention of the Places, that the <hi>French</hi> King had openly declared that it was his deſign to make uſe of them for carrying the War into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Elector his Maſter, in favours of <hi>Sueden,</hi> made a long remonſtrance, which he gave to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-General.</hi> He repreſented to them that his Maſter, their neighbour and good friend, had ventured all, and ſuffered much for the preſervation and ſettlement of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; that he had grounds to hope that the <hi>States-General</hi> would not comply with ſo pernicious deſigns contrary to the faith
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39415:77"/>of their Treaties; but on the contrary, that they would be no leſs careful to procure a Barrier on the ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> than they had been for obtaining one in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and that the preſervation of the Country of <hi>Cleves</hi> was no leſs neceſſary for their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the frontiers of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors received Orders from Court by an Expreſs, to make new Inſtances to the <hi>States-General</hi> to incline them to ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Ghent,</hi> aſſuring them that they ſhould there find his Majeſty as well diſpoſed as they could deſire, to ſurmount all obſtacles that hindered the concluſion of the Peace. It was generally believed that the <hi>French</hi> King did really deſign to remove all thoſe difficulties; but all the Confederates did equally beſtir themſelves to hinder the States from complying with his Majeſties intentions; and amongſt the other reaſons that they alledged to take them off from ſending Deputies, the diſgrace which they ſaid it was, that their Peace was not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Ambaſſadors in the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> made not the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſion on their minds.</p>
               <p>In ſo much that by the anſwer which the Ambaſſadors and Envoy Extraordinary
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39415:78"/>made on the 4th, no hopes appeared of finding any expedient of removing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment that retarded the Peace. They ſaid that they were overjoyed to ſee that the King ſtill teſtified a ſincere inclination for the Peace; but it extreamly troubled them that they found him ſo wedded to the ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> of which neither <hi>Spain</hi> nor the States poſſeſſed any thing of that which was to be the greateſt part of it; that they would always profeſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect they had for his Majeſty, and that they would comply with him in any thing he could deſire of them; but that they perceived not to what purpoſe it could be to ſend Deputies either to <hi>St. Quentin</hi> or <hi>Ghent;</hi> ſince they had no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to offer, but the evacuation of the Places; that if it pleaſed his Majeſty to propoſe any one for facilitating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace, they were ready to ſign it; that they had not made any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary engagements; but with this reſpect to his Majeſty, that they ſhould take no effect, unleſs that he refuſed to evacuate the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the exchange of the Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Confederates were not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſee that a word of the <hi>French</hi> King could conclude a Peace, which overthrew
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:39415:78"/>all their projects, and baniſhed thoſe hopes wherewith they ſtill flattered themſelves But that King had ſo openly declared, that he made but one and the ſame affair of the intereſts of <hi>Sueden</hi> and his own; that unleſs that Crown would deſiſt, he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the engagement he had taken to procure its ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Confederates were perſwaded that an obſtacle clogged with ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could not eaſily be removed, and the rather that there remained but five days of the time that the <hi>States</hi> had prefixed for entering into a League with <hi>England,</hi> from which they could not flinch back, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired not of ſeeing the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peace eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. In the mean time the news that was brought to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> of the birth of the Archduke, filled them all with joy, but eſpecially the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who expreſſed it by publick rejoicing and largeſſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors in the mean while received a Courier from Court; and according to the Inſtructions that he brought them, they framed the Memoir of the 6th, whereby they declared to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the <hi>States-General,</hi> that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King had no deſign in the retention of the places, but to comply with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who judged it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:39415:79"/>for the re-eſtabliſhment of their affairs, his Majeſty was willing to deſiſt from that pretenſion now that the ſame Ambaſſadors conſented to it; but in that Memoir the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors added, that the <hi>States-General</hi> ſhould ſend Deputies to their King, as well for adjuſting the means of warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligation of Neutrality, into which they promiſed that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould enter, as to concert expedients for procuring the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of <hi>Sueden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſtruſt had ſo ſeized the minds of ſome, and was ſo well fomented by thoſe who had cauſe to be afraid of that Peace, that it was not very ſtrange that that Propoſition how ſimple ſoever it was, occaſion'd new jealouſies in the <hi>Dutch.</hi> They were afraid to be drawn in farther than they deſired, &amp; ſaid that ſince the King was pleaſed to remove the great impediment which hindered the Peace; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors could no longer perſiſt in demanding that they ſhould ſend Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to his Majeſty, unleſs they had ſome reaſons which concealed deſigns quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the pretext they took; ſo that they ſeemed further off than they were before.</p>
               <p>The ſame Courier brought back the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors had made to the <hi>French</hi> the 17. of <hi>July,</hi> concerning their deſiſting from the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:39415:79"/>of retaining the places; but they were unwilling to communicate the ſame, until they knew whether the King approved of it in the form that it was drawn up in.</p>
               <p>That Declaration bore, That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſt and general deſign of the <hi>French</hi> King to procure ſatisfaction to the King their Maſter; yet they left it to his Majeſties conſideration, whether after all the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he met with in it, it was better to delay the reſtitution of the places in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a general peace, than to grant it for obtaining a ſeparate peace with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> That for their own parts who had no free correſpondence with the King their Maſter, and had inſtructions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to conform to the pleaſure of <hi>France,</hi> they were aſſured that the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> would be ſatisfied with what his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty thought fit to reſolve upon; not doubting but that his Royal prudence could find out means enough as ſuitable to his Glory, and the re-eſtabliſhment of his Ally, as the retention of places was.</p>
               <p>To this the Ambaſſadors added 7. reaſons to evince, that it was the common Intereſt of both Crowns inſtantly to conclude a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate peace with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to take off thoſe two Powers which ſupported their Enemies: and by ſeven other reaſons they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:39415:80"/>made appear, That his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty might have no leſs renown in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his deſigns by other means, that might make evident to the world the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his intentions, and which at the ſame time might give him opportunity to make the ill affected, who endeavoured to render them ſuſpected, ſenſible of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>By this it ſeemed that the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors foreſaw the future as well as they could at the preſent time; however it be, they clearly ſaw that the obſtacles which hinder'd the peace were otherways inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and ſince they were obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the evacuation of the places, they might hope that the <hi>French</hi> King would not want other means of procuring full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the King of <hi>Sueden.</hi> Nevertheleſs that Prince found the retention of places of ſuch importance to the re-eſtabliſhment of his affairs, that not being informed in time of the urgent reaſons which obliged his Ambaſſadors to conſent to the waving of that pretenſion, he profeſſed himſelf much offended at their conduct.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Provana,</hi> Envoy from the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> on the eigth; he came to demand of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> the portion of the <hi>Infanta, Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:39415:80"/>Great Grandmother to the young Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> or at leaſt he came to have that debt owned by an Article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was to be made betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as it was at the Treaty of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean.</hi> What repugnancy ſoever he met with on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> part, the <hi>French</hi> obtained him his demand.</p>
               <p>Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> finding the term which the <hi>States-General</hi> had taken before they would enter into the Engagements of the Treaty that he had ſigned with them, now to draw near, came on the eighth to <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> All men were perſuaded that his errand was not to facilitate the ſigning of the Peace, nor to bring the diſtant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to a nearer accommodation as to the concluſion of it. His proceedings appeared all along too contrary to the character of a Mediator to make that to be believed. In the mean time on the 9th in the evening, the Ambaſſadors of the States-General had a long conference with the <hi>French:</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them the ſhort time that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for ending that great work, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof was only retarded by a difficulty which ought not to ſeem of great importance to them, in compariſon of the great advantages which the peace would produce; and ſeeing they had not time to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:39415:81"/>tranſlate into <hi>French</hi> the Memoir which they had to give in concerning that, they contented themſelves to tell them the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made no anſwer to the inſtances of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but that their hands were tied, and that without new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they could proceed no further. At length the tenth came, which was the great day that was to give a happy beginning to the repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> or quite quaſh all hopes of it for a long time. Nevertheleſs there appeared no hopes that the peace could be ſigned that day; and it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived why the refuſal of a deputation, which was not abſolutely neceſſary, ſhould put a ſtop to the accompliſhment of ſo great a good. The <hi>Hier Odyke</hi> returned to the <hi>Hague</hi> the 7th. becauſe he had loſt all hopes of peace; but both by reaſon that he believed that the tenth day might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome change in affairs, and that he had Orders from the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to make on the eleventh a proteſtation in name of the States againſt all that could be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if that day paſt without ſigning the peace; he came back the ſame day in haſte to <hi>Nimueguen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hier Boreel,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary from the States-General, went at nine in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:39415:81"/>the morning to wait on the Marſhal <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrades,</hi> and gave him the Memoir made the day before, wherein the States-General thanked his Majeſty for the care which he ſtill took to remove all obſtacles that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the concluſion of the peace, not only with them, but <hi>Spain</hi> alſo; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty to conſider, that the enemies of their State having repreſented to them the evacuation of the places, and the peace at the ſame time as deſperate, they had been obliged to enter into engagements with the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> not to ſtave off the peace; but to take from them the pretext they made uſe of, and to clear his Majeſty from being the cauſe of the ſame. That for that end they had reſerved to themſelves a certain time, which being ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſuffered them not to make the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that his Majeſty deſired; but not doubting but that ſince all the conditions were at preſent agreed upon, the peace would be ſigned before the eleventh, they would not fail to make a deputation, not to St. <hi>Quentin,</hi> but to <hi>Paris,</hi> to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the teſtimonies of their reſpect, and of the ſatisfaction they had from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the peace.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Colbert,</hi> and the Count <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> went at the ſame time to the Marſhal <hi>D'
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39415:82"/>Eſtrades</hi> houſe; but being unwilling to meet the <hi>Heer Boreel</hi> there, becauſe they deſigned all three to go that morning to the Houſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, and to tell them their laſt reſolution, they let the <hi>Heer Boreel</hi> come out without ſeeing him; and immediately after they all three took coach, and went to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors.</p>
               <p>It was believed ſo certainly that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had no power to ſign the peace, that Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> himſelf adviſed thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> to preſs them to it, becauſe he really believed they could not do it. Nevertheleſs the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors declared to them in that conference, that they had power to ſign their Treaties of Peace and Commerce; and that it muſt be done the ſame morning, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The <hi>Dutch</hi> being no leſs perſuaded than the reſt of the Confederates, that without new Orders the <hi>French</hi> could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing, were no leſs ſurprized than overjoyed at that propoſition. All the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles about which there had been any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, were read over; and they agreed to ſign the Peace that day. But ſeeing that conference had laſted from ten of the clock in the morning, until half an hour after two in the afternoon, and that ſome time
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:39415:82"/>was ſtill required to write over the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fair, the ſigning was delayed until the evening.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had found by experience, the importance of ſecreſie for carrying on ſuch a Negotiation to a happy end, in ſo great an Aſſembly, where there were almoſt as many perſons to be feared, as there were Ambaſſadors; and where there was no leſs diſpoſition to conceive jealouſies of the conduct of <hi>France,</hi> than it was eaſie for the Confederates to create new grounds of diſtruſt; and that was the cauſe why the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the laſt, that they could not ſign the peace, upon pretext of a very ſlight obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to the end that the concluſion having almoſt nothing to hinder it, they might in an inſtant ſurpriſe thoſe who expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than ſuch a change.</p>
               <p>The length of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> conference had already ſo alarm'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, that they were all in commotion before it was ended; but they were very ſenſibly touched when they came to know that the peace was concluded, and that it was to be ſigned that day without any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of hindering it. It troubled them the more, that they found <hi>England</hi> acting in their favours in the ſame manner as they had long deſired.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:39415:83"/>
               <p>Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> could not forbear to evidence his diſcontent to the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who went all three together to viſit him in the afternoon, and to acquaint him, that if he thought fit they would ſign the Treaty at his houſe; for upon pretext of ſome indiſpoſition, he received them in his night-cap and gown, and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their offers: whether it was that he had inſtructions ſo to do, or that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired not (for all the matter was gone ſo far) but that before night ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might ariſe that might break off the concluſion thereof.</p>
               <p>That Mediator ſo little expected that the peace ſhould be concluded that day, that he had a Meſſenger ready in his houſe to part at midnight, and to carry news to the States-General of the expiration of the term, which engaged them to the execution of the Treaty that they had ſigned: and that he might let the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſee more clearly that the Mediation approved not that Treaty, he prayed them to put his own and Colleagues names out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; ſaying, that the King their Maſter had not ſent them as Mediators to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Treaty, there to ſign a Separate Peace.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:39415:83"/>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> did all they could to hinder the ſigning of the peace: They framed a proteſtation in the terms that were moſt proper to expreſs their reſentment: They declared to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the <hi>States-General,</hi> That the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they had taken of abandoning their Confederates, was contrary to the faith of the leagues they had ſo religiouſly contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that they conjured them by all that was ſacred, that they would not proceed with ſo much precipitation to the ſigning of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate peace, in a time when they had all taken vigorous reſolutions, and agreeable to the deſires of the <hi>States-General,</hi> in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaſt numbers of Forces into the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> for the relief of <hi>Mons,</hi> which was reduced to extremity.</p>
               <p>They further added, That ſuch a haſty and precipitate conduct was unworthy of a State, that had always governed it ſelf with reaſon and juſtice; and that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a ſtep would be an everlaſting blot to the honour and reputation of the <hi>States-General:</hi> That if notwithſtanding of all that, they were reſolved to proceed, and to enter into a Neutrality ſo contrary to their Engagements, they proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſeparate Treaty, and againſt all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:39415:84"/>the calamities that Chriſtendom in general, and the Princes their Maſters in particular might ſuffer by that ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who conſidered without paſſion the conduct of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> found that they were unjuſtly accuſed of having acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting their Confederates; ſince that by the publick Declarations which they themſelves had given to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors on the 10th and 20th of the preceding Month, they took notice of the neceſſity to which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited-Provinces</hi> were reduced. And the <hi>States-General</hi> were very far from acting with precipitation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſigned not the Peace until the laſt day of the time that they had agreed to with <hi>England,</hi> in caſe that <hi>France</hi> removed (as was then done) all the impediments that for more than ſix weeks obſtructed the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. In a word, it was an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Northern Confederates, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Dutch</hi> to wait patiently, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own confeſſion their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were in a better ſtate, and who daily found new advantages in continuing the War with <hi>Sueden;</hi> whilſt notwithſtanding of all the forces that were in the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King took as many places as he pleaſed, and <hi>Holland</hi> ran on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter ruin.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:39415:84"/>
               <p>The deſire of the <hi>States-General</hi> being conform to the intentions of <hi>France</hi> as to the Peace; nothing could ſtop the ſigning of it; all diligence was uſed to have the Treaties ready, and at eleven of the Clock at night the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors came to the houſe of the Mareſhal <hi>d' Eſtrades</hi> in two Coaches with many Flamboys to light them. The two Treaties of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce were there ſigned betwixt eleven and twelve of the Clock at night, with a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate article concerning the <hi>States</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> poſſeſſes in the Provinces that are under the dominion of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors wiſhed one another mutual joy for the re-eſtabliſhment of the good correſpondence which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the War, and the joy was great and reciprocal amongſt all their ſervants and attendants; but it appeared eſpecially among the ſervants of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, who upon their return knocked at all the Towns-peoples doors, calling to them in <hi>Dutch</hi> that the Peace was made. Next day the Marqueſs <hi>d' Eſtrates</hi> who was at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> parted to carry thoſe two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the <hi>French</hi> King; and the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had the ſatisfaction to find by the firſt diſpatches they received, even before the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39415:85"/>news was brought to Court, that all they had done ſhould be conform to his Majeſties intentions, who upon information of the ſigning of the Peace, acquainted them that he was very well ſatisfied with the wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they had obſerved in ſo great an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
               <p>Seeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were engaged to the <hi>States General</hi> jointly to accept of the peace on the conditions propoſed by <hi>France;</hi> and that the States by the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article of the Treaty which they had ſigned, were Guarantees to the <hi>French</hi> King of all the obligations to which <hi>Spain</hi> was to be bound, and eſpecially to that of an exact Neutrality; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors would loſe no time in promoting the peace of <hi>Spain,</hi> but on that occaſion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the office of Mediators, as it was neceſſary they ſhould, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in a manner excuſed themſelves from media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by refuſing to propoſe the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ninth of <hi>April,</hi> and to ſign the peace with the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news that were brought of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the <hi>French</hi> Army obtained daily over the Forces of the Empire, made it probable that after the peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> which began ſeriouſly to be treated, it would not be long before the Emperor
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39415:85"/>and Empire came to an accommodation. The Marſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had ruin'd the Fort of <hi>Kiel,</hi> at the end of the bridg of <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Germany;</hi> and having burnt the Bridg, and raiſed the Fort on the other ſide, he very much incommoded that great City, and made them apprehenſive of the ſame fate that had befallen all thoſe places which the <hi>French</hi> had attacqued.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>States General,</hi> who looked upon the peace of <hi>Spain</hi> to be as neceſſary for their repoſe, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Commerce, as their own peace, made the ſucceſs of that Negotiation their own particular affair. It was, indeed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in <hi>Holland,</hi> that thoſe two Treaties ſhould be ſigned at the ſame time; and therefore the joy which the people concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the concluſion of the former, was much leſſened by the fear they had that the ſecond would not be ſo ſoon conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as was deſired; but ſeeing both parties were equally deſirous of the ſame, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors went firſt to the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States General,</hi> and there exchanged the projects of peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they might the better facilitate the Treaty, and conclude it with as little loſs of time as poſſibly could be, they agreed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39415:86"/>to meet at the Houſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors; and for that effect they gave one of their Chambers, which was at the end of their Hall of Audience, to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors; another that had an Entry from the Porch, was for the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain;</hi> and all the Gentlemen belonging to the ſeveral Ambaſſadors, ſtayed in the Hall of Audience, which ſerved for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the <hi>Heer Beverning,</hi> who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the <hi>Heer Haaren,</hi> applied himſelf induſtriouſly to remove the difficulties that happened in that Negotiation, carrying back and for, from one Chamber to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the controverted Articles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Beverning</hi> is no leſs a man of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, than knowledg and ability; and therefore in the Conferences of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, which laſted four hours in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and as long after dinner, a great part of the Articles of the Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> were condeſcended to, and agreed upon: but the fourteenth, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were interrupted, and all people were ſurpriſed to hear that Ambaſſador <hi>Temple</hi> parted that day from <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four of the clock in the morning, for the <hi>Hague,</hi> where perhaps he had ſtill hopes of bringing ſome obſtacle to the ratification of the Treaty, though he could not hinder the ſigning of it.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:39415:86"/>
               <p>In the mean while ſeeing it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſo important an affair as the Negotiation of a peace betwixt two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent States can be ſo happily ended, and no unexpcted accident fall out that may hinder the concluſion of it; ſeveral obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles aroſe in the courſe of this Treaty which retarded it much longer than was expected. It was hoped that the Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be renewed on the fifteenth; but that day the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadours made report to the <hi>French,</hi> that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the <hi>French</hi> King had of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bouvignes</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> put a ſtop to the Treaty, and might quite break it off, If his Majeſty perſiſted in his pretenſions to thoſe two places, whereof the one is a little Town almoſt ruined, ſituated upon a hill below <hi>Dinant;</hi> and the other a Bourg without fortifications, lying towards <hi>France,</hi> in the Countrey betwixt the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Sambre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that in the project of the peace no mention was made neither of <hi>Bouvig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> nor <hi>Beaumont;</hi> and that they were not named in the printed Conditions. But to that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made anſwer, That they were in the Conditions which the <hi>French</hi> King had propoſed to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who by his Ambaſſadors had
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39415:87"/>communicated the ſame to all the Miniſters of the Princes that were at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> and ſeeing his Majeſty had in his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ninth of <hi>April</hi> named preciſely all the places which he intended to reſtore to <hi>Spain,</hi> and not all thoſe which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty reſolved to retain, theſe were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily comprehended amongſt the laſt, ſeeing they were in actual poſſeſſion of the <hi>French,</hi> and of too ſmall importance to be expreſly named in the Conditions.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe difficulties put a ſtop to the Treaty at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> there was a report ſpread abroad of the defeating of the <hi>French</hi> Army before <hi>Mons;</hi> into which it was affirmed that great relief was put du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Fight. The truth was, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having drawn together the Forces of <hi>Holland, Spain,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, reſolved to attempt the relieving of it on the fourteenth, afternoon; the hopes he had of ſucceeding in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe with ſo great forces, and of ending ſo many Campagns by a famous action, which till then had been ſo unfortunate to him, concurring with the urgent inſtances of the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> Envoy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary from the Emperor, were motives powerful enough to incline him to give battel, and to make the beſt of ſo fair an
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39415:87"/>opportunity. Many have thought that that Prince had advice by an Expreſs from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen,</hi> that the peace was concluded there on the tenth; but however it be, having had no information thereof from the <hi>States-General,</hi> he was not obliged to know it.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> who had received advice of the Peace by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs from the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, could not perſuade himſelf that the Enemies who appeared on the Eminencies of the Abbey of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> had a deſign to attacque him. But when it was paſt all doubt, and that he perceived they had poſſeſſed themſelves of the Village of <hi>Caſteau,</hi> he paſſed over the rivolet that divided his Camp from that poſt, with ſome Regiments of Horſe, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and foot; theſe Troops, led by the beſt Officers of the Army, marched through narrow paſſes, gullies, and unfrequented ways, beſet by the Enemies on the right and left, and had a ſmart and bloody en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; but the <hi>French</hi> retook <hi>Caſteau</hi> and ſet it on fire, with leſs loſs on their ſide than on that of the Enemy's, though the fight continued till night put an end to the action.</p>
               <p>Next morning the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to the Camp, to acquaint the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39415:88"/>Marſhal of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> that the peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States-General</hi> was ſigned the tenth; and that he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the news of it until that night. He therefore deſired, that ſince the countenance of affairs was changed, he might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſend a Convoy unto <hi>Mons.</hi> But the General refuſed it, ſeeing he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto till he had received Orders from Court.</p>
               <p>This action of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived various conſtructions, and was not altogether approved by the <hi>States-General,</hi> who ſaw to their regret, ſo many brave ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers uſeleſly ſacrificed to private intereſts. Nor was it well reliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe two thouſand of the ancient Regiments of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britains</hi> forces, who were in the States ſervice, were totally routed in that Engagement. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Fight being brought to <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> undeceived the Confederates, who were at firſt informed that the ſucceſs of it was much more advantageous to them than indeed it was.</p>
               <p>The Nuncio, who was very ſolicitous for promoting the General Peace, by means of the Imperialiſts inclined all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to a Months truce. He was hopeful that in that time the Negotiation might
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39415:88"/>have ſome ſucceſs; and that Truce had been concluded, if the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck,</hi> who then returned from <hi>Cologn,</hi> had not broken all the meaſures that were taken in his abſence. The impediment which the Confederates obſerved to be put to the Peace of <hi>Spain,</hi> made them leſs concerned to make their own. But the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> being gone to the <hi>Hague,</hi> made many hope that that Miniſter would bring from thence ſome expedient to remove the difficulties that put a ſtop to that Negotiation; and that at the ſame time he would have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Ratifications of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peace.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, ſince by the Letters which the <hi>States General</hi> wrote to the <hi>French</hi> King the 22. of <hi>June,</hi> they entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty to grant them Paſſports for the ſecurity of their Merchant Ships; a Courier brought a great many from Court to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors; but they would not exchange them at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> for a like number with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved the <hi>Dutch</hi> to deliver theirs firſt at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> into the hands of the Poſt-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>France,</hi> who was to acquaint the Court that he had received them. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not juſt that the ſubjects of the <hi>States-General</hi> ſhould have freedom to trade
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:39415:89"/>alone with the Paſſports of <hi>France,</hi> whilſt the ſubjects of that King might ſuffer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> men of War, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Paſſport of the States; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors engaged themſelves to procure from the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> as many Paſſports for the <hi>French,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> ſhould give to the States.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King continued to teſtifie the ſincerity of his intentions by ratifying the Treaty of Peace without delay. On the 22. a Courier brought the Ratification to <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> and at the ſame time his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty appointed the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> to be his Ambaſſador Extraordinary to the <hi>States-General.</hi> The terms wherein his Majeſty wrote to them on that ſubject, teſtified the affection that he had for that Republick, by the choice he made of a ſubject whom he judged the fitteſt to renew the ancient ties of amity which the late times had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> who could not but with great trouble ſee the great diſpoſition that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the Peace of <hi>Spain,</hi> made the ſame day a vigorous Remonſtrance to the Ambaſſadors of that Crown. They doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but that the glory that was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſignifying the ſame conſtancy after
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39415:89"/>the unexpected ſigning of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peace, would render them ſtedfaſt and unſhaken in the obſervation of their Treaties of Alliance. They ſaid that their Maſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing more than the repoſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom; but that their Enemy propoſed the Law to them, inſtead of admitting a Treaty upon the conditions which might conduce to a General Peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ambaſſadors employed afterwards all their Eloquence to divert <hi>Spain</hi> from the courſe they ſaw it taking; they repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, That the conſtancy of that Crown was alone capable to reclaim thoſe who had deviated from their duty through the influence of the Cabal, and the levity of ſome who underſtood not how dear faith and ſincerity ought to be to a Free State. That what <hi>France</hi> left to <hi>Spain</hi> by that Peace, in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was rather to exhauſt its Treaſures, than that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave that crown in the peaceable poſſeſſion thereof. That they hoped <hi>Spain</hi> would not yield to the common Enemy the glory of being more conſtant in favours of their Allies, than themſelves. In fine, that if their Maſters found themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and abuſed, they would have care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time how they helped to quench the fire, ſince they ſaw themſelves ſo ill reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their pains.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:39415:90"/>
               <p>On the 24. the Articles that were made betwixt the two Armies, were brought to <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> They were both at the ſame time to draw off to an equal diſtance from before <hi>Mons;</hi> but the Troops that block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the place, were not to retire till two days after. In the mean time there were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reports of the Ratification of the States-General. All the Provinces at that time held their ſeveral Aſſemblies to give their reſolutions as to that point to the States, who ſeemed leſs inclined than the Provinces to keep their word, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with the exactitude with which <hi>France</hi> ſeemed to act in execution of the ſigned Treaty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> returned to <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> on the 27. where having conferred with Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins,</hi> who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved new inſtructions from <hi>England,</hi> he had audience of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, and would have them to underſtand that his Maſters were ſo far engaged to procure the peace of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they would be very glad to ſee the difficulties that hinder'd the concluſion of it, removed, before they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Peace which they themſelves had made; and that his Majeſty of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> had by Mr. <hi>Hyde</hi> his Ambaſsador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and Plenipotentiary, whom he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:39415:90"/>had ſent purpoſely to the <hi>Hague,</hi> made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſſing inſtances to them on that ſubject in favour of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, the expreſſions of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir which that Ambaſſador gave to the <hi>States-General</hi> on the 25th agreed not with the procedure that <hi>England</hi> had hitherto held for promoting of the peace. That King made known to the <hi>States</hi> that he was ſurpriſed to underſtand that they had ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſeparate peace without including <hi>Spain,</hi> and without any Guarantee for the evacuation of the places within the time limited. That ſince the new pretenſions which <hi>France</hi> formed to the County of <hi>Beaumont</hi> and the Town of <hi>Bouvignes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the accompliſhment of the peace, his Majeſty thought that the condition put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the laſt Treaty was fallen; and that he and the <hi>States-General</hi> were equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to enter into a joynt War againſt <hi>France.</hi> That if the <hi>States</hi> would refuſe to ratifie what they had ſigned at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> offers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare actual War againſt <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>States-General</hi> having already made great inſtances to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that he would uſe his power with the <hi>French</hi> King for obtaining for them the Neutrality of the Countrey of <hi>Cleves</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:39415:91"/>and <hi>Juliers,</hi> the Ambaſſador of his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by the ſame Memoir aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, That the King his Maſter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be no leſs neceſſary to the States, that their Provinces ſhould be covered on that ſide, than on the ſide of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was ready upon that account to enter with them into what meaſures they ſhould judg convenient; and that the obtaining of that ſecurity depended only on themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Forces that were newly raiſed in <hi>England</hi> for the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> paſſed daily over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders</hi> by <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Some of them at <hi>Bruges</hi> upon a miſtake had ſuffered a Riot from the Rabble upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and the <hi>Flemings,</hi> who are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, were not well pleaſed with Heretical ſuccors. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who found in their Confederates, and the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſo great a diſpoſition of maintaining their Intereſts, reſted ſatisfi'd, and ſhewed no more deſire for the concluſion of the peace.</p>
               <p>They found ſome advantage by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; for the <hi>French</hi> Forces being now by the Treaty of <hi>Mons</hi> retired out of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Territories, attempted no enterpriſe; and <hi>France</hi> being uncertain of the iſſue of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> peace, and of the ratification of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Treaties, their Forces could not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39415:91"/>march into <hi>Germany,</hi> where they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ruined the affairs of the Emperor and Empire. Beſides, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates which they ſtarted concerning the difficulties in which they were ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, in ſome manner ſaved the honour of their Nation; and they had at leaſt the advantage of not receiving the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſputes and oppoſitions; which was ſo far from rendering their conditions worſe, that it could not, on the contrary, but procure for them more advantageous terms.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> 1678. the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors by an Expreſs from Court received new inſtructions, and in the conference which they had the ſame day with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, they told them, That for the good of the general peace, they had power to remit in their pretenſions. So that next day the conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were again renewed at the houſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, who carried the propoſitions and anſwers back and for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were in ſeveral rooms. The Articles in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie were adjuſted on the mornings and forenoons meetings. Next day they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; but the difficulties that were raiſed concerning the condition of the places
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39415:92"/>which the <hi>French</hi> King was to deliver up, as well in reſpect of Ammunition and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, as of the Fortifications, hindered the Treaty from any great progreſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom it moſt concerned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> omitted nothing that could put a ſtop to it; and upon a pretext that <hi>France</hi> kept not to the ſole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the ninth of <hi>April,</hi> they made great noiſe in <hi>England,</hi> and engaged his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſo far, by many proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conform to their intentions, that in the ſequel it would not be eaſie for him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon any of their concerns. One of the chief means they made uſe of at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> to break off the peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> was to get the Mediators to propoſe a Truce for ſix months, during which they hoped that the differences of all the Princes who were engaged in the War, might be happily end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But hitherto their opinions as to that were quite different, ſeeing they had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Truces that had been propoſed to them. In the mean time the Northern Confederates made great preparatives for putting in execution a new enterpriſe, which they deſigned upon the Iſle of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Matters were in ſuch a ſtate, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of one difficulty ſeemed to be the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39415:92"/>neceſſary cauſe of another; and that ſo great an affair as Peace could not be brought forth without great ſtratagems. The ſeventh and eighth were ſpent in the <hi>Heer Bevernings</hi> frequent coming and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to demand of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors the clearing of ſeveral doubts which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> raiſed to all the Articles of the Treaty, ſaying that they had ſecret notices, which being but confuſed, rendered them ſcrupulous and diſtruſtful upon the ſmalleſt appearances. In fine, they demanded an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication concerning the Chattelleny of <hi>Aith,</hi> which was the ground of a difficulty of little leſs conſequence than that of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignes</hi> and <hi>Beaumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since that <hi>Chattelleny</hi> was yeilded to the <hi>French</hi> King by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle,</hi> his Majeſty diſmembred ſeveral Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from it, and adjected them to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Tournay,</hi> and in that ſtate the King pretended to deliver back this <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleny;</hi> but whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought fit of themſelves to demand that explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that they were put upon it by others, they deſired a particular clauſe concerning that to be put into the Treaty; and upon the refuſal of the <hi>French</hi> Ambabaſſadors, they framed a Memoir, which they gave to the <hi>States-General.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:39415:93"/>
               <p>They ſaid that the diſmembring of the <hi>Chattelleny</hi> of <hi>Aith</hi> made by the <hi>French</hi> King, abſorped the chief part thereof; that no leſs lay at ſtake than ſeventy Villages, and the City of <hi>Leuze,</hi> which is but a league and a half diſtant from <hi>Aith.</hi> That ſince his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made no reſervation of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of that <hi>Chattelleny,</hi> as he had of <hi>Verge</hi> and <hi>Memin,</hi> depending on <hi>Courtray,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors by refuſing the clauſe demanded, ſhewed but a captious fetch, that they might reſtore to <hi>Spain</hi> but a part of ſo conſiderable a <hi>Chattelleny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> were in great pain to know what could have given the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ground at that time to make that reflection upon the diſmembring of the <hi>Chattelleny</hi> of <hi>Aith,</hi> and to think that the deſign of the <hi>French</hi> was to make their advantage of the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might have been made thereof in the Treaty. The truth is, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have had no ground of complaining if <hi>Aith</hi> and its <hi>Chattelleny</hi> ſhould have been reſtored to them in the condition that it has been ſo long in.</p>
               <p>They could not imagine what was the reaſon of this new emergent; but it was obvious, that the Prince <hi>de Lignes,</hi> who has a great Eſtate in the diſmembred part of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39415:93"/>that <hi>Chattelleny,</hi> having ſent a Secretary to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> upon the account that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him to have his Lands return again to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, had without doubt given the <hi>Spaniards</hi> information of that affair, and of the neceſſity of inſerting a clauſe concerning it in the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> acted not in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with the ſame zeal as he had formerly made appear. The diſtaſts he had received the laſt time that he had been at the <hi>Hague,</hi> made him proceed much more ſlowly than his uſual application did allow: for after all the pains he had taken to end a War which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſupport, he little expected to have his conduct blamed. Nevertheleſs they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to let him ſee that there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faults and conſiderable omiſſions in the Treaty which he had ſigned.</p>
               <p>The five principal were theſe: Firſt, that in the Preface the <hi>French</hi> King ſeemed to be the Protector of the <hi>States-General,</hi> though it contain no term but what is conform to his Majeſties Letters, and the anſwers of the States. Secondly, That the Neutrality to which the <hi>States-General</hi> were engaged by that Treaty, was indefinite, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent might be extended beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War. Thirdly, That the <hi>Heer Bevern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:39415:94"/>had exceeded his commiſſion, in having obliged the <hi>States</hi> to warrant the Neutrality of <hi>Spain.</hi> Fourthly, That he had omitted an Article of <hi>Amniſtie</hi> and <hi>Oblivion,</hi> which ought mutually to be ſtipulated in all treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace. And Laſtly, That he had forgot to mention the <hi>Barriere,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King granted to <hi>Spain,</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the ſecurity of the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though moſt of thoſe faults were more grounded on the diſcontent of thoſe who regretted the concluſion of the Peace, than on any important or dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; yet the <hi>French</hi> King was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſatisfie the <hi>States General</hi> in any thing that might farther concern them. And ſeeing the indefinite term of their Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralitie, and the warranting of that into which <hi>Spain</hi> was to enter, were the points that appeared to be of greateſt importance. the explication thereof which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors gave to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> according to the deſire of the <hi>States,</hi> was approved and ratified by his Majeſty at <hi>Fontainblean,</hi> the 5th of <hi>September,</hi> in the ſame manner as if it had been inſerted in the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors underſtood by the Letters which Courier brought them on the 9th, that the Court was perſwaded that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39415:94"/>there would be greater difficulty in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> than had been at firſt imagined; and that was partly the cauſe why the <hi>French</hi> King gave Orders to the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> to go with all diligence to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where his Majeſty judged his preſence neceſſary. But ſeeing affairs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared then to be in a better ſtate at <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> than was believed at Court, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador departed not. However another Courier having on the 10th brought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe from the King, whereby his Majeſty referred to the <hi>States-General</hi> the deciſion of all the differences that retarded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> The Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> arrived on the 11th at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where it was not difficult for him to obſerve that there were many there fully inclined to introduce (if they could) ſome change in the State, whereinto the ſigning of the Peace had put the affairs of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it was already known, that all the Provinces had conſented to the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Peace, ſome abſolutely, and others upon conditions which they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the determination of the States; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that before the end of ſix weeks the Ratifications might be exchanged if no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſtopt the concluſion of the Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:39415:95"/>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> forces that in ſo great number came over into the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> bred great umbrages in <hi>Holland;</hi> the people could not tell what need there was of an Aſſiſtance that came not till the peace was concluded. And ſeeing they were not as yet totally cured of the doubts they had conceived of the ſincerity of <hi>France,</hi> no more than of the jealouſie that ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of the too great authority of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> moſt part knew not but the peace which was made, might be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make them fall the more eaſily under a dominion, the encreaſe of which was poſſibly one of the reaſons that made them embrace the peace.</p>
               <p>In fine, a Courier on the 13th having brought Letters from the <hi>French</hi> King, whereby his Majeſty removed all obſtacles that hindered the concluſion of the peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> returned on the 17th to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which he had that day at the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador's houſe, that laſted till two of the clock afternoon, all the Articles were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, and that the peace ſhould be ſigned that evening. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors cauſed the Treaty to be tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and the Tranſlation was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Mr. <hi>Colbert,</hi> who found two or three
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39415:95"/>words to be amended, which did not exactly quadrate with the ſenſe of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors had been the Mediators of the Peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> their houſe was thought the moſt convenient place to ſign the Peace at. They cauſed their Hall of Audience to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that Ceremony. They entered it by a great door about the middle; the Chair of State ſtood at one end, on the left hand of the door, and the Chimney juſt oppoſite on the right. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors room had an Entry into the Hall on the ſide of the Chimney; and that which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain,</hi> had its Entry on that of the Chair of State. There was a long Table ſet croſs the Hall, one end of it towards the door, and the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the windows; but ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> would not have the Chair of State to be on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, it behoved to be removed; and the Chimney which was on the right hand as one entred, making too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction on that ſide, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors cauſed it to be covered with a piece of Tapiſtry, that none in their houſe might have any cauſe of diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors came to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors Houſe about nine of the clock at night with ſeveral Coaches filled
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39415:96"/>with Gentlemen. They were no ſooner in their Chamber, but the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> gave them notice that all things were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and having the Treaties in his hand, he went and ſate down at the upper end of the Table, and the <hi>Heer Haaren</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league at the other end. At the ſame time were opened the doors of the two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the Ambaſſadors advanced in equal pace from their ſeveral Apartments, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all three a breaſt. As matters were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spain</hi> had two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages; firſt, that they were on the left hand as they entred the Hall: and next, that advancing to the Table in the rank which they were to keep, the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> was forced to give his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues the right hand, becauſe otherways he could not ſit oppoſite to the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> nor at the upper end of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>All the Ambaſſadors ſate down at the ſame time, the Gentlemen on either ſide ſtanding at the backs of their Chairs. The Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtrades,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes,</hi> took each of them a Pen, and at the ſame time ſigned the Treaty which the <hi>Heer Beverning</hi> preſented to them. Then the other Ambaſſadors took the Treaty and the Pen, and ſigned it in the ſame colume,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39415:96"/>every one on the right hand of his Treaty, and exchanged them after the firſt ſigning. The <hi>French</hi> ſigned that of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that of <hi>France</hi> in one colume, to the left of the former, leaving room for the ſeals, which the Secretaries took care to place at the end of every ſubſcription. This being done, all the Ambaſſadors aroſe, and complimented one another ſtanding, during the ſpace of half a quarter of an hour; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they returned to their Chambers as before, from whence they ſeverally reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Next day after the ſigning of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace, the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> with his whole Train parted for <hi>Nimueguen</hi> by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in quality of Ambaſſador Extraordinary to the <hi>States-General,</hi> who told him upon his arrival, that the Ratification of the Treaty was ſent to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> where they were exchanged on the 20th with all the teſtimonies of mutual ſatisfaction among the Ambaſſadors, who gave marks of their good intelligence by feaſting and mutual rejoycings.</p>
               <p>The Northern Confederates were at that time more than ever inclined to conſent to a truce; but the <hi>Suedes</hi> would not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely agree to it: they would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of it in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39415:97"/>they had ground to fear that the great loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they had there ſuſtained, might be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by others more conſiderable; but they were not for it in <hi>Schonen,</hi> where their affairs were in a better condition, by the taking of <hi>Chriſtianſtadt,</hi> which they had at length made themſelves Maſters of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the loſſes they felt in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> were of greater importance to them than all they could gain elſewhere. The Confederates at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> were at that time much ſurpriſed at the news of the death of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter;</hi> they had reaſon to fear that it might bring ſome alteration to the projects that they were forming. However the great preparations that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> were making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iſle of <hi>Rugen,</hi> were not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded. The Elector embarked his forces in ſeveral ſhips, and was himſelf preſent at their landing; which was ſo happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, that in leſs than a day he render'd himſelf Maſter of the whole Iſle, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing of time he went and beſieged <hi>Stralſond,</hi> which he took two days after he had begun to batter it.</p>

               <p>What inclination, in the mean time, the <hi>French</hi> King made appear to the peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Miniſters of the Emperor ſtill laboured to perſuade the Diet at <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> that his Majeſty deſired no peace, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he propoſed an Alternative of which both parts were equally impractible. They ſaid that the Emperor could not render <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> becauſe by the Leagues which he had made with moſt of the Princes of the Empire, he had obliged himſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh it, as a place prejudicial to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and that if he delivered up <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> he would thereby leave all <hi>Briſgow</hi> and the Foreſt-Towns under the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>France,</hi> and give the <hi>French</hi> a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Empire with more advantage than they had before by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Philipsbourg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For overthrowing theſe reaſons, which were thought pretexts to ſtave off the Peace, and to render the intentions of the <hi>French</hi> King ſuſpected; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors declared in his Majeſty's name, That he conſented to the demoliſhing of <hi>Philipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi> and that to remove from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Empire all cauſes of jealouſie and fear concerning <hi>Briſgow</hi> and the Foreſt-Towns,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:39415:98"/>he was ſatisfied with the City of <hi>Fribourg</hi> and three Villages under its juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. This propoſition blaſted all the reaſons of impoſſibility which were alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the practability of the Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on which the peace of <hi>Germany</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
               <p>In the mean time all diligence was uſed to put <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> in a condition of being render'd up to the <hi>States-General</hi> according to the intent of the Treaty of peace. And in effect, the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> having given his word to the <hi>States-General</hi> that it ſhould be evacuated by the ſixth of <hi>October;</hi> the ſame day they took poſſeſſion of it, with the greater ſatisfaction to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that there were ſome ſtill amongſt them who continued to poſſeſs them with diſtruſt, and to perſuade the people that <hi>France</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to cheat them, and that the King would not ſurrender <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Forces that poſſeſſed almoſt all the paſſes on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to all the Neighbouring Princes who were engaged in the War. The Duke of <hi>Newbourg,</hi> who had moſt reaſon to fear, was the firſt that deſired of the <hi>States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> that he might be comprehended in their Treaty, and enjoy the benefit of the Peace according to the 19th Article, which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39415:99"/>gave them power to name their Allies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of ſix weeks, that they might be included in the Treaty. That Prince had the greater reaſon to hope that by this means he might put himſelf out of danger, in that he was really an Ally of the <hi>States,</hi> and that he had declared that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Peace before the expiration of the ſix weeks.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Mayence</hi> and <hi>Treves</hi> made the ſame Declaration, and the ſame demand to the <hi>States-General,</hi> by a Memoir which the Baron of <hi>Leyen</hi> preſented in their names at the <hi>Hague.</hi> But what inſtances ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the States made in favour of thoſe Princes, and what aſſurances ſoever they gave that the Emperor himſelf would ere long accept the Peace, they could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any thing in a matter which they thought juſt, and conform to the Article of their Treaty, before they heard the reaſons which the <hi>French</hi> alledged againſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.</p>
               <p>On the 30th the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> returned from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> whither he went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſigning of the Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> It was thought that he brought the Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty, becauſe the ſix weeks wherein the exchange was to be made, were expired the day before. Nevertheleſs he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39415:99"/>brought it not: but the <hi>French</hi> King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent an Expreſs to the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> that Ambaſſador declared to the States on the fifth of <hi>November</hi> 1678. that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the negligence of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Majeſty was willing in conſideration of them, to prolong the time of the exchange of the Ratifications until the 20th of that month. And by the next Courier that came, news was brought that in compliance with the inſtances of the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-General,</hi> his Majeſty had granted the whole Month.</p>
               <p>At that time the Plenipotentiary of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> declared, That his Maſter accepted the Peace upon the terms propoſed by the <hi>French</hi> King the 9th of <hi>April;</hi> and at the ſame time choſe the ſecond part of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative, by which <hi>Nancy</hi> was to remain to his Majeſty, who in exchange thereof gave him the City of <hi>Toul</hi> upon the conditions ſpecified in the Article of the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which concerns that Prince. The <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> who promiſed himſelf that all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acceptations of Peace would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the concluſion of the General Peace, employed all his care and pains with much zeal to incline the Emperors Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and the Miniſters of other Catholick Princes, not to defer any longer the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:39415:100"/>compliſhment of ſo great a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King in the mean time well perceived that theſe Princes of the Empire conſented only to a ſeparate Peace, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of putting themſelves out of danger of his Arms, and not with deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it upon conditions that reſpected the Empire in general, ſeeing they deſired no more but to be comprehended in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Treaty, and conſented not to the reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> which granted free paſſage to his Majeſties forces through the Empire, ſo often as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould march that way for the execution of the ſame Treaties. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King yeilded not to the deſire of thoſe Princes, though the <hi>States-General,</hi> who made it a point of honour to procure them the benefit of their peace in the midſt of War, pretended they had right to have them included in their Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Bouvean d' Epenſe,</hi> whom the King permitted the Spring before to take a journey to <hi>Berlin,</hi> to ſee the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> his old Maſter, about that time came back to <hi>Nimueguen:</hi> though he was wholly addicted to the Intereſts of his Electoral Highneſs before the War, yet his Majeſty did not for all that repoſe leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him; for upon his return from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:39415:100"/>
                  <hi>Berlin,</hi> finding the King in <hi>Flanders</hi> after the taking of <hi>Ghent,</hi> his Majeſty ordered him ſtill to wait upon him, deſigning to make uſe of all opportunities that might offer to renew a good correſpondence with the Elector. And therefore he came to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen</hi> with particular inſtructions from the Court to contribute what he could to that peace; and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nothing without his conſent, in the tranſactions that paſſed at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Negotiation.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Ambaſſadors could not as yet reſolve to give their conſent to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confirmation of the Treaties of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia;</hi> it was the thing that created them moſt trouble, and which was moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Authority that the Emperor had acquired during this War. They declared, as the reſt did, that his Imperial Majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the peace; but they conſented not to the paſſage of the <hi>French</hi> forces through the Empire, and they deſpaired not but that they might even derogate from theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by thoſe which they were to make with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden.</hi> And as to the alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Emperor would yeild it to the King in the manner as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors propoſed.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:39415:101"/>
               <p>Seeing the <hi>States-General</hi> ſtill pretended that thoſe Princes ought to be included, who being their Allies, declared within ſix weeks after the exchange of the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that they accepted the Peace. The <hi>French</hi> King made appear by the Memoir, that the Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> gave them on the 18th of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. that in that juncture the private Princes of the Empire could not be conſidered ſeparately from the Emperor and Empire; and that they could not neither accept a ſeparate peace upon the conditions propoſed by the King, ſeeing his Majeſty had made no conditions for them in particular, but only for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Empire in general; and that they ought all to be comprehended in one and the ſame Treaty.</p>
               <p>That reaſon had not been ſo good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Emperor, who was expreſly mentioned in the <hi>French</hi> Kings project; and the <hi>States-General</hi> would have willingly been aſtricted to the incluſion of him alone; but it was repreſented to them, that his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty could leſs pretend to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peace, than any other Prince, ſince the term of ſix weeks after the exchange of the Ratifications was expired without any formal acceptation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Peace by the Ambaſſadors, in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:39415:101"/>the manner that they were propoſed, for the Emperor had not as yet conſented to the paſſage which the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> give the King through the Empire; ſo that the not conſenting to the corroboration of the ſame Treaties, the fulfilling wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>States-General</hi> deſiſted from that pretenſion; and ſeeing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not ratifie the peace, and that it was uncertain what might be the effect of this long delay, they began to fear that if the time granted by the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and <hi>Spain</hi> not ratifie the Treaty, the War might begin afreſh in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces to them, and that they might be thereby deprived of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage which they expected from their peace. Upon this conſideration the States beſought his Majeſty further to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the time of the exchange of the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; but the King on the 30th not only acquainted them, that in conſideration of them he was willing ſtill to grant fifteen days as the longeſt delay; but his Majeſty alſo aſſured them, that he was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the apprehenſions they might have for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns on their frontiers; and that he would even deliver up into
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:39415:102"/>their hands thoſe places which he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to render to <hi>Spain,</hi> to be kept by them until the conſummation of the peace with that Crown.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the <hi>French</hi> King requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the <hi>States-General,</hi> that in purſuance of the Treaty of peace, they would cauſe to be paid to him the Arrears of Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Countrey of <hi>Kuyck,</hi> the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordom of <hi>Boiſ-le-duc,</hi> the Barony of <hi>Breda,</hi> and of the Marquiſate of <hi>Bergen-op-zoom;</hi> and that they would draw their forces out of the Countrey of <hi>Leige:</hi> that otherways his Majeſty would have cauſe to take the longer abode of their forces in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as a violation of the Treaty, and a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit aſſiſtance given to the Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> his Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Negotiation of the peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, proceeded ſtill very ſlowly, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made no haſte to exchange their Ratifications; and therefore his Majeſty cauſed to be declared to the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor, That if in the Month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> they did not conclude the peace, his Majeſty would not afterward conſent to it upon the ſame conditions. And to oblige <hi>Spain</hi> to haſten the Ratification, the King ordered that <hi>Ghent</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Waas</hi> ſhoule pay contributions proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:39415:102"/>to the great number of Forces that he was obliged to maintain in the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi> until the ratification of the peace. So that all the Countrey which was to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuffer'd more in that ſhort time, than it had done during the whole courſe of the War; and all that, that it might not be ſaid that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had abandoned the Emperor by ratifying their peace before that his Imperial Majeſty had concluded his own.</p>
               <p>So great was the terror at that time throughout the whole Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> that upon the noiſe of the approach of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, moſt part of the Inhabitants left the Countrey, not doubting but that notwithſtanding the contributions that they ſhould pay, the <hi>French</hi> King would poſſeſs himſelf of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> to oblige the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> to give ſatisfaction to <hi>Sueden,</hi> the affairs whereof could not be worſe than they were in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Gripſwald,</hi> which was the only place that the <hi>Suedes</hi> retained in that Province, had ſurrender'd to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and that by that means the <hi>Suedes</hi> were wholly beat out of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> nevertheleſs was ſenſible, that notwithſtanding the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:39415:103"/>that he and his Allies might have over <hi>Sueden, France</hi> had ſo declared for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction of that King, and ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly eſpouſed his Intereſts, that it was in vain to imagine they could obtain other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from that War, than what the <hi>French</hi> King thought fit to allow them. In proſpect of this, his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty cauſed his Envoy at the <hi>Hague</hi> to negotiate ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Count <hi>D' Avaux:</hi> That Prince proteſted that he reſigned all his Intereſts into the <hi>French</hi> Kings hands; that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no other Mediation than that of his Majeſty; and that he would conform to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that it ſhould pleaſe him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. But no poſitive anſwer was made to all theſe general propoſitions; there was a neceſſity of coming to the preciſe point, if any thing was to be expected to be done.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors received the Ratification of the Peace in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 1678. but ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> King had granted them until the 15th for making the exchange, they endeavoured to draw ſome advantage from the ſhort time that ſtill remained; ſaying that they could not deliver the Ratification until they had the interpretation which they demanded of ſome Articles of the Treaty, and eſpecially
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:39415:103"/>concerning the <hi>Meſſineſes,</hi> whom they would have excluded from the Treaty, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an Oblivion to all the Rebel-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Catholick Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that was given why the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> did not what they could to hinder the <hi>Meſſineſes</hi> from enjoying the pardon that the <hi>French</hi> King procured them by the Treaty, was that ſeveral Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> had obtained the confiſcation of the chief Rebels of <hi>Meſſina;</hi> and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt they had to bring things ſo about, that by virtue of the Treaty they ſhould not have power to diſpoſe of their Eſtates, was one of the chief reaſons that had ſo long deferred the Ratification, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent had ruined ſo many private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewiſe demanded, That in caſe the Commiſſioners that ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the two Kings to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Villages which they ſhould find prejudicial to the ſetling of the limits, could not agree amongſt themſelves as to the value of the exchanges, the difference ſhould be referred to the determination of the King of <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors condeſcended to none of thoſe unſeaſonable demands, being reſolved rather to break off, than to innovate the leaſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:39415:104"/>thing in the Articles that were agreed upon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>States-General</hi> made even a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> on the 13. that they not only deſiſted from the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they pretended to give to the Emperor, and Princes of the Empire; but that they would likewiſe abandon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> if they ratifi'd not the Treaty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fifteen days, being unwilling to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the <hi>French</hi> King for a longer delay; and that they hoped in a ſhort time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Emperor to accept the peace.</p>
               <p>In effect, the Imperialiſts on the 12. gave their counter-project, wherein nevertheleſs they changed their mind as to the option that they had already made of <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and added ſeveral Articles which were not conform to what was agreed unto with the Mediators. They demanded that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould indempnifie all thoſe of the Empire who had ſuffered any damage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War. That the Princes of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtembourg</hi> ſhould by their ſubmiſſions crave pardon of, and make publick ſatisfaction to the Emperor for having eſpouſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Intereſts. And that the King ſhould not have the Soveraignty over all the Ways that he demanded in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:39415:104"/>
               <p>Theſe propoſitions quite contrary to the project which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors gave to the Mediators, who approved all the Articles therein contained, made the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the deſire and conduct of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts to be doubted of, or at leaſt they made their ordinary irreſolution appear; particularly touching the choice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative; about which having once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves, they ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to change again. But the truth was, they never imagined that the <hi>French</hi> King liked <hi>Fribourg</hi> as well as <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> but that yielding to him the latter, they would put his Majeſty to a plunge, inſomuch that the deſire that he would have to make them change their choice, might produce ſome advantage for them. But they were no leſs miſtaken in that point, than in their hopes of getting new Articles inſerted into the Treaty; for the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would not admit of any, nor derogate in the leaſt from the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> except in the Alternative of <hi>Fribourg</hi> for <hi>Philipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had now ſpun out the time until the end of the laſt delay which the <hi>French</hi> King had granted to them, but found no way longer to defer the exchange of the Ratifications, nor any hopes that the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:39415:105"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors would grant them the leaſt thing of what they remanded ſince the ſigning of the Treaty. So that on the 15. they delivered their Ratification. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was made without any ceremony at the Houſe of the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States General,</hi> whither the Secretaries went to fetch them. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors finding that the Ratification of <hi>Spain</hi> was not altogether in the form that it ought to have been in, they declared that they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no otherways than in ſo far as it ſhould pleaſe the King their Maſter.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts finding the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors as inflexible in reſpect of them, as they had been in regard of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> deſpaired of obtaining liberty to change the choice which they had already made of the Alternative; ſo that on the 24. they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they ſtood to the Election that they had made of <hi>Philipsbourg;</hi> and that they might not ſpend the whole Month, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them that the King would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here longer to the conditions of the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> they entred into publick conference, that they might in good earneſt endeavour the concluſion of the peace. Theſe Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were held in the Town-houſe, where the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor, <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:39415:105"/>and <hi>Sueden,</hi> with the Mediator <hi>Jenkins,</hi> had all ſeparate rooms.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Nuncio employed himſelf very uſefully for promoting the peace, yet he appeared not as publick Mediator, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> could not join in one Mediation; and that <hi>England</hi> was admitted by all the other Princes who were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Negotiation. The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently to ſtop the courſe of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and repreſented vigorouſly to the Imperialiſts, that every ſtep they made, were ſo many breaches in the Treaties of Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which his Imperial Majeſty had made with the Princes their Maſters.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-General</hi> perceiving that in the few days which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the Month, it was not poſſible to conclude a Treaty wherein ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties appeared in the very beginning, prayed the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to prolong the delay which that King had granted. Their anſwer was, that they had no power to do it; but that nevertheleſs they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if the Treaty were in readineſs to be ſigned, his Majeſty might give a new delay.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Seſſion of Conferences, the four firſt Articles of the Project of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:39415:106"/>were reduced to one; the <hi>French</hi> refuſing to fill the Treaties with needleſs Articles, and ſuch eſpecially as only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned thoſe matters which <hi>France</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſufficiently adjuſted by the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> whereof they demanded the corroboration and accompliſhment. And ſeeing by the treaty the Emperor and all the Princes of the Empire were not only to remain neutral, but were alſo to take from the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden</hi> all means whereby they might make any advantage or profit by the Countreys of the Empire, whilſt the King might make uſe of them for reſtoring <hi>Sueden;</hi> his Majeſty by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors demanded ſuch places as he ſhould ſtand in need of after the peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for a free paſſage from his frontiers to the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the fifth of <hi>January</hi> 167<hi rend="sup">8</hi>, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors declared that the places which their King intended to reſerve, were <hi>Caſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Huys, Verviers, Aix-la-Chapelle, Duren, Linninch, Nuys,</hi> and <hi>Ordingen,</hi> that was the ſtraighteſt and ſhorteſt march that the <hi>French</hi> Forces could have to the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and his Majeſty was already poſſeſt of all thoſe places, which being open, and without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, ſhewed that the deſign of the King was only to make uſe of them, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39415:106"/>he might oblige to the obſervation of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> thoſe Princes who contrary to the faith of the ſame Treaties deſired to continue the War after the peace of the Empire, that they might retain the poſſeſſion of the Countreys which they had taken from <hi>Sueden,</hi> whilſt his Majeſty to procure ſatisfaction to that King his Ally, had ſurrendred a great many good places, and made peace in a time when he might have expected great advantages from the ſucceſs and proſperity of his Arms.</p>
               <p>At that time news was brought that the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army was come out of <hi>Livonia.</hi> For the ſpace of two years there was a talk of its marching, though it advanced not one ſtep. But at length it entred into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and having poſſeſſed ſome places on the River of <hi>Wemel,</hi> it was advanced to the middle of that Province. There was the greater probability, that the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe would contribute to their peace with the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> that in the mean time whilſt that Prince was marching all the Forces he had in <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> to oppoſe that irruption, he ordered <hi>M. Meinders,</hi> his Miniſter and Councellor of State, to go in diligence to the <hi>French</hi> Court, the King having granted him a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for that effect. <hi>M. Meinders</hi> was at that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39415:107"/>time at <hi>Nimuegueu,</hi> being come back from the Elector his Maſter, to whom he went upon occaſion of the propoſitions which the Count <hi>D' Eſpenſes</hi> had brought; but ſeeing the chief thing contained in theſe propoſitions, was the entire reſtitution of all the Conqueſts which the Elector had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from <hi>Sueden,</hi> the obſtacles that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the concluſion of the Treaty, were ſo hard to be digeſted, that his Electoral Highneſs judged it far more convenient to negotiate the peace with his Majeſty, than to treat at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> This Prince was the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined to take this reſolution, becauſe thoſe who continued ſtill in War, were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally thinking of making their Treaties apart.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Imperial and <hi>French</hi> ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors continued in the Town-houſe, and it began to be hoped that the Negotiation would come to a happy concluſion. The Plenipotentiary of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> at that time endeavoured to obtain what the Imperial Ambaſſadors had in vain eſſayed; he ſuppoſed that his Maſter dreamt not that the ways which the <hi>French</hi> King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from <hi>Nancy</hi> to <hi>Mets,</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> County and <hi>France</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the King in ſoveraignty; and upon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39415:107"/>that pretext he pretended to change the choice he had made of the Alternative, and to accept <hi>Nancy</hi> for <hi>Toul;</hi> but the reaſon he alledged having no appearance of the leaſt foundation, he could not obtain the liberty of a new choice, no more than the Imperialiſts could, after they had once accepted <hi>Philipsbourg:</hi> ſo that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might eaſily have perceived, in the courſe of that Negotiation, that he was miſtaken in expecting greater advantages, if he were admitted into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorrain</hi> under the protection of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, than if he received it from the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and generoſity of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>Seeing new difficulties were daily ſtarted in the Negotiation of the Peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the King was willing to prolong the delay he had given until the end of the Month; but that retarded rather the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, than it promoted the Treaty: for beſides that the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who always ſeemed irreſolute in bringing things to a concluſion, deſired no better, than not to puſh on buſineſs when they had time before them; they were ſo ſenſibly touched at thoſe burthenſom conditions wherewith the King clog'd that prolongation, that if they could have found any other remedy for the calamities of the Empire, beſides a ſpeedy
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:39415:108"/>Peace, they would not have diſſembled their reſentment. The King conſented not to that delay, but on condition, that if the Peace were not ſigned before the Month was expired, <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> ſhould be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, for the reimburſment of the charges that his Majeſty was obliged to be at, for maintainsng his Forces: and that if <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> likewiſe paſſed without concluding the Peace, his Majeſty would moreover have all <hi>Briſgow</hi> in recompence of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the <hi>French</hi> King could be no leſs than abſolute Maſter of Peace and War, to impoſe ſuch a neceſſity upon the <hi>Imperialiſts:</hi> Nevertheleſs, whether it were the fears of ſeeing themſelves expoſed to undergo theſe conditions, or a ſincere deſire of freeing the Empire as ſoon as poſſibly could be from ſo troubleſome a War, ſet the Imperial Ambaſſadours to work; the Negotiations of Peace grew brisker than before; they met morning and evening, and had very long conferences; ſo that Sir <hi>Lionell Jenkins</hi> had trouble enough in going back and fore betwixt them, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to renew the impediments which retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Negotiation; and yet for all that, the Peace advanced but ſlowly.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:39415:108"/>
               <p>The Imperialiſts ſtarted great difficulties about the 26. and 27. Articles of the Treaty; and ſeeing they all tended to annul the rights which <hi>France</hi> had obtained in the Empire by the peace of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe which have been yeilded to that King over the ten Towns of <hi>Alſatia;</hi> the debates that aroſe upon that ſubject, were many and hard to be adjuſted.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Emperor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they gained no ground by theſe debates, and that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors would not conſent that thoſe things which were concluded by the peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſhould any ways be infringed by this Treaty. They endeavoured at leaſt to obtain, that the points to which the <hi>French</hi> would not condeſcend, might be referred to arbitration. But this was to as little purpoſe as the extraordinary repugnancy they ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor being obliged to obſerve a neutrality in the Empire, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> King might march his forces for the relief of his Allies. Nevertheleſs all theſe points were at length agreed unto in the manner as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>The jollities of the Carnaval were at that time very great in <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> where the people, who ſince the change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:39415:109"/>and Government, has not been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſee Maſquarades, took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in theſe Novelties, and eſpecially in a frolick of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> magnificently diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who went through all the Town drawn on ſledges upon the ſnow at a Ball in the Houſe of the Ambaſſador of <hi>Denmark</hi> on the 24. Two men appeared diſguiſed into <hi>Capucins,</hi> of whom one having danced with the Neece of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the hand to <hi>Madamoiſelle Colbert;</hi> but <hi>Monſieur Colbert</hi> being preſent, ſtopped the Maſquer, telling him that it was not the cuſtom of <hi>France</hi> to dance in ſuch habits; and that if he had him at his houſe, he would ſerve him as he deſerved.</p>
               <p>The forwardneſs of the peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, gave the Northern Confederates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to think of; for, for all they were ſo well united among themſelves, yet when the matter was of oppoſing thoſe who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclined to make a ſeparate peace, they were not wanting to mind their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concerns. The journey of <hi>M. Mein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> Envoy from the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> gave them great umbrage, and made them fear that a ſeparate peace with that Prince would quite ruine their affairs; and therefore they reſolved ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevent the diſadvantage that might
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:39415:109"/>happen to them by continuing laſt in the War; but their peace depended on the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who being ſo highly ſupported by the <hi>French,</hi> ſeemed no leſs haughty as to the propoſitions that were made to them, than if they themſelves had been in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving the Law to their enemies.</p>
               <p>The morning and evening conferences of the 29. and 30. were very long, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors met and diſcourſed together; ſo that there was no queſtion made of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs of the Negotiation. Ambaſſador <hi>Temple,</hi> who upon the advice he received that the Treaty was upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded, parted from the <hi>Hague</hi> on the 29. arrived on the 30. at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> that he might ſign that peace, though many things ſtill remained to be adjuſted. The Ambaſſadors were at the Town-houſe from eight of the clock in the morning, until two afternoon. And as it was not doubted but that that laſt day would put an end to that great work, the end of the evening-conference, which began at four of the clock, was impatiently expected; but it laſted till five of the clock next morning, and yet the peace in no condition to be ſigned.</p>
               <p>The affairs of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took up much time; and in that conference M. <hi>Stratman</hi> made a long and elegant diſcourſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:39415:110"/>in <hi>Latin</hi> concerning the pretenſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of that Prince; though M. <hi>Colbert</hi> expected no ſuch thing, and that he had no time to prepare himſelf for an anſwer, yet he anſwered <hi>ex tempore</hi> with ſo much force and perſpicuity, that the whole Aſſembly were ſurpriſed at it.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed that the Imperialiſts perceiving that the delay granted by the King, expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the preceding day, purpoſely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered affairs to be ſpun out beyond that term, to the end that it might not be ſaid that they had ſuffered it to expire without a concluſion, and that they had incurred the penalties upon which the <hi>French</hi> King granted a ſecond prorogation. No other buſineſs remained to be determined but the affairs of the Houſe of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> and the poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> with the granting the demand of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, who would have the reſult of the Diet of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> mentioned in the Treaty, by which it might appear that the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently authoriſed to ſtipulate in the name of the Empire.</p>

                  </gap>/2;: The greateſt difficulties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length diſcuſſed, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors declared that they had power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for two days the laſt delay that their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:39415:110"/>King had granted. But the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> finding that no obſtacle could hinder the concluſion of the peace of the Empire (though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of their Maſters at the Emperor's Court aſſured them of the contrary in all their Letters; and though the Imperial Ambaſſadors themſelves proteſted to them at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> that they would not act in reference to them, but as faithful Allyes): the firſt of <hi>February</hi> about eleven of the clock at night, they made a long and ſmart Remonſtrance to the Imperial Embaſſy, that they might endeavour as much as in them lay, to divert the blow which they then ſaw nearer than they had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>They told the Imperial Ambaſſadors, that their proceedings with the common Enemy ſo much the more allarm'd them, as that in the place where they were ſhut up, they could not come to ſpeech with them, that they might repreſent to them how ſenſibly it affected them to ſee that they made my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of that which the Enemy ſcrupled not to make publick; that they intreated them to conſider the faith of their leagues, the Decrees of the Empire, and the wrong they would do the Princes their Maſters, if they reſtored <hi>Sueden</hi> to the benefit of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:39415:111"/>Treaties of <hi>Weſtpbalia,</hi> contrary to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn concluſions that declare they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the ſame; that above all, they pray'd them to give away nothing of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them; and not to ſuffer that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of peace the war might be carried into thoſe parts of the Empire into which the Enemies Forces were never as yet able to advance.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ambaſſadors added to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance a kind of threatning; ſaying, that if the Imperialiſts abandoned them to the diſcretion of their Enemies, they ought not to take it ill if they made uſe of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wn misfortunes for obtaining ſome repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from thoſe who would ſacrifice them in that manner. In fine, they adjured them by the Majeſty of the Sacred Empire, that they would conclude nothing contrary to the Rights of their Maſters, ſeeing they were ready to make peace jointly with them upon equitable conditions, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to take all neceſſary meaſures for a vigorous reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Confederate Ambaſſadors nicked the time in making that Remonſtrance; for the Conference from which the Imperial and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were juſt come, ended in a total rupture, and with ſo much animoſity on both ſides, that thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39415:111"/>deſired the peace, had cauſe to fear that the Treaty could hardly be ſet on foot again. But notwithſtanding of that, Ambaſſador <hi>Jenkins,</hi> who ſhewed no leſs prudence than zeal in his conduct, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered affairs, that next day (being the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Month) the Conferences were renewed.</p>
               <p>Seeing the difference that remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Dutchy of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> was that which at that time created the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the concluſion of the peace, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was thought it would have broken off the Treaty; the <hi>Nuncio</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt that ſingle difficulty might obſtruct the fruits of ſo long and difficult a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, ſo ordered matters, that the <hi>Sieurs Charun</hi> and <hi>Vanderveck,</hi> Envoys from the Prince and Chapter of <hi>Liege,</hi> declared, That ſince nothing but the pretenſion which their Maſter had to the Dutchy of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> hindred the peace, they conſented that upon the account of that particular Intereſt, the welfare and repoſe of the whole Empire ſhould be no longer retarded. By that means all things were adjuſted, and in the ſame Conference (which laſted till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night) the Ambaſſadors agreed to ſign the Treaty.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:39415:112"/>
               <p>Tho' the peace concluded betwixt the Emperor and <hi>France,</hi> ſufficiently provided for the ſecurity and ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> ſeeing it reſtored that Crown to all that the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> gave it in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; yet there was a neceſſity of a ſeparate Treaty for <hi>Sueden,</hi> becauſe that King had been declared an Enemy to the Empire, and fallen from the advantages which he had by the peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi> That Treaty was therefore ſet on foot with great diligence, and had all the ſucceſs that the particular care of the <hi>French</hi> King could procure for the concerns of his Confederate. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> was made the rule and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of this; all Acts, Decrees, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates made to the contrary, were reſcinded and declared null by it, as innovations intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced during the troubles of the War: the neutrality of the Emperor, and reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Gottorp,</hi> were therein ſtipulated, and all proteſtations that could be made to the contrary, declared null and of none effect.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> ſeeing the peace fully conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the third of the Month, made their proteſtations againſt it; they complained that the Emperors Ambaſſadors had conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to matters which ſo nearly concerned the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:39415:112"/>Princes their Maſters, that they had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected all their intereſts, but alſo that they had given their Enemies liberty to purſue the War even into the heart of their own countrey: That they had treated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rights of all the States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſo far as to aboliſh ſome Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, without the knowledg of the Princes who were moſt intereſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In a word, they ſolemnly proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſeparate peace, which ought to be reckoned null, and no way prejudicial to their Leagues, nor to the Decrees of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ambaſſadors omitted no formalities which they judged neceſſary for maintaining the pretenſions of their Maſters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 4th they made a conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the peace made by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with <hi>Sueden,</hi> becauſe they ſaw it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be concluded and ſigned the ſame day with that of the Emperor with <hi>France.</hi> They ſaid that they could the leſs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the Imperial Ambaſſadors would do ſuch a wrong to the Princes their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; that <hi>Sueden</hi> had been treated during the War, as a State and member of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, guilty of breaking the publick peace, and in that notion cited and condemned by the Empire in the uſual forms. So that in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:39415:113"/>what manner ſoever the Emperor might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelf to that Crown, they had reaſon to proteſt againſt the validity of that peace, and at the ſame time for all the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages that their Maſters might ſuffer thereby.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters and Plenipotentiaries of the Princes of <hi>Brunſwick-Lunenbourg,</hi> who hitherto had exerted no publick act of their function, the ſame day proteſted againſt thoſe two Treaties in the ſame terms, and upon the ſame pretexts that the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had done. Perhaps they were ignorant that the Princes their Maſters were concluding their particular Peace at home with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> whilſt they complained ſo loudly at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> againſt that of the Emperor. Nevertheleſs theſe proceedings hinder'd not but that the peace was next day ſigned, though the Imperial Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors endeavoured under various pretexts to have the ſigning of it delayed.</p>
               <p>The 5th at noon theſe Ambaſſadors ſent the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s Auditor to entreat the <hi>French</hi> that they would defer the matter until the day following, in reſpect there was ſo much Writing required before the Treaty could be drawn up fair, that it was impoſſible it could be ready to be ſigned that evening.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:39415:113"/>But all the anſwer they had was, That there was time more than enough for putting things in a condition; and that if the peace was not ſigned by ten of the clock, they had orders from the King their Maſter not to ſign it next day.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed to be the fate of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors not to ſign any Treaty of peace; they refuſed to ſign that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> becauſe it was ſeparate, and had been managed without their privity; and they medled not in that of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on the former: But ſeeing they had been the Mediators of the Treaty of the Empire, they thought nothing ſhould have hinder'd them from ſigning that peace. Nevertheleſs the Ambaſſadors of his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty having failed in yeilding the honour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as Mediators, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of <hi>Cologn</hi> and <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> which occaſioned, though no obſtacle nor difficulty in the courſe of the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they were likewiſe ambiguous in their anſwers, when the Mediators ſent to enquire of them how they pretended to carry themſelves in the ſigning of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>But when they were upon the point of going to ſign the Treaty, the Imperial Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors poſitively declared, That they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:39415:114"/>would not conſent that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould ſign firſt. So that ſeeing they could not ſign it either as Mediators, in which caſe they ought to have the firſt place, as due to them in that quality; or as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for then the <hi>French</hi> would not write after them; it was impoſſible to find out any expedient to adjuſt that difficulty. And therefore Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>Temple</hi> ſaid true, when he proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time before, That he would not ſign the Peace whilſt the affairs of <hi>France</hi> were in ſuch a condition as to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to the advantage of that Crown. And all the fruit of his haſty journey to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> to ſign a Peace ſo advantageous to <hi>France,</hi> was his diſpleaſure for underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in the coldeſt ſeaſon that for theſe twenty years has been known in <hi>Holland.</hi>

               <p>Upon the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors refuſal to delay the ſigning of the Peace until next day, the Imperialiſts loſt no time, and all things were ready that evening. About ten of the clock all the Ambaſſadors went to the Town-houſe with ſeveral Coaches, and many Flambeaus: So ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were in their Chamber, they ſent to compliment the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and to tell them, That when they pleaſed they would come into the Hall which was prepared for the ſigning of the Peace. The Imperialiſts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:39415:114"/>returned them the ſame compliment; and ſo the <hi>French</hi> entred firſt into the Hall, which was above ſtairs, and oppoſite to their room; and they placed themſelves at the Table on the left hand of the entry.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Imperial Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors came up, and took place over-againſt the <hi>French.</hi> The dores were open, and a great many Gentlemen of both Nations, and ſeveral others whom curioſity to ſee ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a ceremony, had invited to <hi>Nimue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> ſtood behind the Ambaſſadors. M. <hi>Stratman</hi> brought the Treaty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and M. <hi>Colbert</hi> that of <hi>France.</hi> The Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> had affairs at the <hi>Hague</hi> that hinder'd him from being at that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. The two Treaties were written in <hi>Latine,</hi> and for comparing of them M. <hi>Stratman</hi> began to read; but having read ſome pages of it, M. <hi>Colbert</hi> offered to eaſe him; and the whole Treaty being ſo read over by turns, the Imperialiſts according to their ſeveral qualities ſigned it in one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume on the right hand; then they took that of <hi>France,</hi> which they ſigned in the ſame manner; whilſt the <hi>French</hi> ſigned that of the Imperialiſts in one colume on the left hand, as the Imperialiſts did that of <hi>France;</hi> but the Count <hi>d' Avaux</hi> being abſent, a ſpace was left for his name, and a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:39415:115"/>Chair ſet in the place which he ought to have taken.</p>
               <p>Afterward the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck</hi> made a congratulatory compliment upon the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concluſion of ſo great an affair as the Peace of the Empire, which would reſtore repoſe and tranquility to the reſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom that were ſtill in War. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Northern Princes who were not comprehended in that Peace, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the conduct of the Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, ſpoke in another ſtrain of language. M. <hi>Heng,</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſador next day after, publickly expreſſed his diſcontent at the houſe of the Marſhal <hi>D' Eſtrades.</hi> He ſcrupled not to ſay openly in company, yea and ſeveral times to repeat it, That if it pleaſed the <hi>French</hi> King, he had ſufficient authority to conclude a League with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and to get it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, who would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf to make war againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in what manner, and for as long time as his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould deſire him.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Emperors Ambaſſadors could not obtain of the <hi>French,</hi> that an Article ſhould be put into the Treaty, whereby the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould conſent to refer to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration the difficulties which they raiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:39415:115"/>the Rights of the ten Towns of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> of the Nobility of that Province, and of the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> before they ſigned the Peace, they entred a proteſtation into the Records of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, that it might appear, that though they had right to pretend that theſe affairs ought to have been referred to arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they had rather conſent that no mention ſhould be made of them in the Treaty, than longer to delay the concluſion of the Peace for matters of which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors abſolutely refuſed to take cognizance; contenting themſelves to proteſt that that omiſſion could no ways be prejudicial to the rights of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> refuſed alſo to inſert into their Treaty with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the verbal declaration which they gave of the ſenſe of the third Article, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that they pretended not that that Article ought to oblige the Princes of the Empire that were ſtill in war, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> as to what concerned <hi>Sueden,</hi> knowing that theſe were affairs that ought to be adjuſted by particular Treaties.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs upon the refuſal that the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> made of inſerting
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:39415:116"/>that interpretation into the Treaty, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Ambaſſadors prayed the Mediators that they would make mention of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in their Memoirs, and to ſet down in them by way of proteſtation, that if in the Treaty of the Emperor with <hi>Sueden</hi> there is no mention made of the cuſtoms that are raiſed at <hi>Termeude,</hi> of the rights of the Dukes of <hi>Mecklenbourg,</hi> nor of thoſe of the Town of <hi>Bremen;</hi> the reaſon was only, becauſe the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> alledged that for want of a free correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his <hi>Suediſh</hi> Majeſty, they could not have inſtructions as to the points for which the Imperialiſts thought it not fit to delay the ſigning of the peace, ſince that without ſuch a clauſe, theſe Rights were as well eſtabliſhed under the authority and protection of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Though the Treaty of the Peace made betwixt the Emperor and <hi>Sueden,</hi> was not figned until the 7th. yet it bore date the ſame day with that of the Emperor and <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it was mentioned therein to be of the ſame date. And ſome time after, the news was brought that the peace of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> with the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick-Lunenbourg,</hi> was ſigned at <hi>Zell</hi> on the ſixth, by M. <hi>de Pabenack,</hi> who after that the <hi>Suedes</hi> were wholly out
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:39415:116"/>of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> ſtopping at <hi>Hambourg,</hi> went by order from the King to the Court of thoſe Princes, who by this Treaty reſtore to the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and all that they had got of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> except the Bailiage of <hi>Tedinghanſen,</hi> which hath always been controverted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is incloſed within the Territories of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and the Provoſty of <hi>Dowen,</hi> that lyes between the <hi>Weſer</hi> and the <hi>Elbe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Suedes</hi> likewiſe yield to thoſe Princes ſome Revenues of the Church, conſiſting in tythes which belonged to them upon account of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and ſome other Benefices. But the <hi>French</hi> King being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fully to indempnifie the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and to ſecure the peace of the Empire, his Majeſty by that Treaty enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to pay to theſe Princes three hundred thouſand Crowns, at the ſame time that the reſtitution is made to <hi>Sueden</hi> in the manner as was agreed upon.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>de Meyerkron</hi> continued to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he ſeemed willing to have managed a Negotiation with the Count <hi>d' Avaux;</hi> but the offers he made, were ſtill ſo general, that they gave no ground for a poſitive anſwer. And therefore that Ambaſſador made him the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:39415:117"/>ſame declaration that the other <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors made at <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> telling him that in order to a more favourable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> muſt begin, by releaſing the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Soldiers, who ſince the time that they were ſhipwrackt upon the Iſle of <hi>Barnholm,</hi> were not only detained priſoners contrary to the priviledg of the Paſports which they had; but likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to violence, which they daily ſuffered on deſign either to make them engage in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> ſervice, or forſake that of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> That the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> would by ſo doing purge himſelf from the ſuſpitions of that ſhipwrack which the King never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs was rather inclined to attribute to Chance, and the miſtake of Pilots, than any premeditated deſign; but that in the mean time, the inhuman manner of uſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of thoſe forces could not but be thought very ſtrange.</p>
               <p>Though from the beginning of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, many inſtances had been made, and ſeveral expedients propoſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> for procuring to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Sueden</hi> the liberty of Couriers, or at leaſt of bare Letters to and from his <hi>Suediſh</hi> Majeſty; yet it could not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> This gave occaſion of fear, that the ſtrictneſs which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:39415:117"/>was obſerved in that Kingdom upon that ſubject, might hinder the conveyance of the Treaty newly ſigned with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, into <hi>Sueden;</hi> and that the ratification thereof might not be brought within the limited time. And therefore the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Sueden</hi> hired privately a Galliot at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arried the Meſſenger to <hi>Gottemberg,</hi> from whence he might go by Land to any place where the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Court was.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of the Emperor hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtipulated for the whole Empire in the Treaties of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> by virtue only of the concluſion of the Diet of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon</hi> of the 31. of <hi>May</hi> 1677. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> produced a copy of it at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> on the 18th of the Month, with a new proteſtation, alledging, that that concluſion of the Empire was not conform to the ſenſe that was put upon it in the 36 Article of the Emperor's Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and in the 12. of that of the Emperor with <hi>Sueden;</hi> and that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ambaſſadors were ſo far from having by that means ſufficient authority to treat in name of the whole Empire, that on the contrary the Emperor was thereby requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conclude nothing at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt ſubmitting it to the deliberation of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39415:118"/>the Diet; and that the Ambaſſadors of his Imperial Majeſty, by adding in theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, That all proteſtations that might be made in the Empire againſt that Peace, were to be of no effect; had committed the greateſt violation, and manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened the Golden Bull, the Imperial Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations, the Conſtitutions of the Empire, and the very Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> on which they pretended to ſettle the peace of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Although the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> ſaw themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by all their Allies, and left alone in the War, expoſed to all that <hi>France</hi> could undertake againſt them both by ſea and land; yet they could not be brought to a reſolution of reſtoring what they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered from <hi>Sueden;</hi> they dealt with the <hi>French</hi> King, and with his Ambaſſadors; but his Majeſty gave them anſwer, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Ambaſſadors to do the like, That he could not liſten to the propoſitions that they made to him; that he had no quarrel with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> nor the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> that they ſhould give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Sueden;</hi> and when that Crown was contented, his Majeſty would be ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> King ſtopt not there: for after that the Peace was ſigned, his Majeſty
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:39415:118"/>deſiring that the reſt of <hi>Germany</hi> might likewiſe be at quiet as ſoon as poſſibly could be, on the 24th of <hi>February</hi> did by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors declare to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediator, That if within the Month of <hi>March</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> did not give full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to <hi>Sueden,</hi> his Majeſty ſhould then be at freedom to demand new condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would be, that <hi>Lipſtadt</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the Elector of <hi>Cologn;</hi> and that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> ſhould pay to his Majeſty all the Charges of the War.</p>
               <p>That Declaration of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the anſwers which his Majeſty gave to all the propoſitions, which came ſhort of a full ſatisfaction to <hi>Sueden,</hi> were the more uneaſie to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> that he had juſt then forced the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to leave <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and to return with much haſte into <hi>Livonia,</hi> but more haraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſickneſs and long marches, than the loſſes they ſuſtained in ſeveral skirmiſhes, which happened in their tetreat betwixt the areerguard of the <hi>Suedes</hi> and ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Electors Forces.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> finding their affairs in a better condition ſince the peace, thought themſelves obliged to remit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39415:119"/>of their pretenſions; and therefore they patiently expected the effect of the <hi>French</hi> King's Declaration, and of what his Majeſty was preparing to do for them. They made no doubt but that all would terminate in the ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great effects on their part. They found that the Forces of <hi>Denmark</hi> were weakned in <hi>Schonen,</hi> becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> began already to recall the Forces which his Predeceſſor had ſent to his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, who without that aſſiſtance could hardly make head againſt the <hi>Suedes</hi> in <hi>Schonen.</hi> The <hi>Suedes</hi> reckoned the Treaty of that Biſhop as good as already conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He is indeed of a peaceful diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but nevertheleſs vigorous and firm, as a great Prince ought to be, in maintaining his lawful pretenſions by the Sword. The concluſion of his Treaty ſtood in effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an hundred thouſand Crowns; and that Prelate was ſatisfied that <hi>Sueden</hi> ſhould leave no more in his poſſeſſion but only the Bailliage of <hi>Wilſhonſen,</hi> as a Mortgage for the payment of that ſum.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> on his part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſetling the Empire by procuring the Peace of the North; and that that could not be done, but by re-eſtabliſhing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39415:119"/>the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> for which the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ought to be concerned. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Miniſters who were at that Diet, found that the Proteſtation which the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> cauſed to be made there, wounded the Authority of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty; moſt of the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> ſaw evidently, that none had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the War, but thoſe that deſired not Peace; ſo that it was to be hoped th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> private Intereſts would at length give place to the publick concern of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and that the paſſion which thoſe Princes had to ſpoil <hi>Sueden,</hi> could not long ſtave off a Peace which was ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by ſo many people.</p>
               <p>The Emperor had already teſtified how much he concerned himſelf in the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sueden,</hi> by his deſire to procure the repoſe of the Empire. The Letter which the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> wrote to his Imperial Majeſty the 24th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> gave occaſion to an Anſwer; which made him fully underſtand, That he had no cauſe to hope that the Empire would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Intereſts. He complained that the Emperor ſeemed diſpoſed to peace, ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the other Princes who continued in War; and that the project of the peace
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39415:120"/>of the Empire, which his Majeſties Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors had made at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> offered and contained ſuch conditions as neither <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Sueden</hi> would have demanded, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a time when having driven the <hi>Suedes</hi> wholly out of the Empire, he had for ever ſetled and ſecured the peace and tranquillity thereof.</p>
               <p>But all the reaſons that his Electoral Highneſs alledged to incline the Emperor to continue the War, and to procure bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conditions for him, were overthrown by that Anſwer, which bore, That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> would have done better not to believe that the Emperor had ever any deſign to act againſt equity, or to engage in any proceeding contrary to the concluſions of the Diet of the Empire. That his Imperial Majeſty ſaw plainly, that all his Confederates had made War only for their particular Intereſts, ſince they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him by making ſeparately their peace: But that his actings were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, ſeeing he would not divide his Intereſts from thoſe of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, upon which he would have certainly drawn the utmoſt calamities, if he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thoſe examples. Moreover, that in the league made betwixt his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and his Electoral Highneſs, there was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39415:120"/>nothing to be found that obliged the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to procure to his Highneſs the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Conqueſts that he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Sueden:</hi> That on the contrary the Conſtitutions of the Empire required that that Crown ſhould always be one of the chief members thereof. In fine, that the Emperor himſelf was ſo far from liſtening to the reaſons that were alledged for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the War, that he had willingly yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of his own Revenue for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a firm Peace.</p>
               <p>In the ſame anſwer, the Emperor put the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> in mind, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving engaged with the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> in the beginning of this War with conſent of the Emperor and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he had afterward againſt all reaſon changed his Conduct, and without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them, joined with <hi>France;</hi> that his Imperial Majeſty had much ado to take him off from that engagement, drawing upon himſelf great enemies thereby, and giving him conſiderable advantages: That by threatning, as he did, to conclude a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Peace as often as his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had by his Miniſters made propoſitions of peace to him, he himſelf had given him cauſe to mind his own, and to leave him on his part to do as he ſhould think good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:39415:121"/>In a word, that it was not for the intereſt of the Empire, that <hi>Sueden</hi> loſing the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories that it had therein, ſhould lye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the catch to regain them, and be continually ſtirring upon that account, to diſturb the publick Peace; and that therefore he would by conſequent do well to think of making his accommodation with that Crown.</p>
               <p>Though the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had no great ground to rely upon their Negotiations, and that they plainly ſaw that the Conditions of Peace depended abſolutely on the pleaſure of the <hi>French</hi> King, yet they left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing undone at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> which they judged neceſſary to maintain their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> perceiving that the Declaration made by the <hi>French</hi> the 24th, threatned his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs with the loſs of <hi>Leipſtadt,</hi> and the reimburſement of the charges of the War, if within the Month of <hi>March</hi> he concluded not the Peace, made on the 26. a kind of citation to the Ambaſſadors of the Princes, who had made their Peace with <hi>France,</hi> that he might let them ſee the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation they ſtood in of warranting the Leagues which his Electoral Highneſs had made with them upon occaſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:39415:121"/>
               <p>All theſe Declarations were conceived almoſt in the ſame terms; but in that which that Ambaſſador gave to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he ſaid that the rigour which the <hi>French</hi> King ſhewed towards his Electoral Highneſs, was an effect of the ſeparate Treaties that ſome of the Confederates had made with <hi>France,</hi> to the prejudice of his Maſter; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that before he could anſwer the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, it was neceſſary he ſhould know how his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty pretended to diſcharge himſelf of the engagement he had made with his Maſter by the 14 and 24 Articles of their League, whereby the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not only to procure Peace to his Electoral Highneſs, but alſo to indemnifie him as to the loſſes that he might ſuffer in the Countrey of <hi>Cleves.</hi> And ſeeing the term preſcribed to his Maſter by <hi>France</hi> was very ſhort, he prayed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, with all expedition to inform him of his Catholick Majeſties intention as to the performance of thoſe two Articles, that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly make his anſwer to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Theſe formalities were no real advances towards the Peace. The Ambaſſadors of the North ſtill flattered themſelves with the hopes, that the ratification of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39415:122"/>Peace might meet with ſuch obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> as might change the face of affairs. Nevertheleſs that Dyet was of a quite contrary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing but the intereſts of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> retarded that ratification on the Emperors part.</p>
               <p>I muſt here call to mind what I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before, that the <hi>French</hi> King having granted five different Plenary Commiſſions, for treating with the five principal Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates that were engaged in War againſt his Majeſty, he would give no particular one for treating with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> (though all the Confederates had ſollicited it by means of the Mediators); and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Prince having been obliged to liſt himſelf under ſome one or other of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, committed his concerns to the care of the Ambaſſadors of the Emperor, who in the Treaty that was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Emperor and <hi>France,</hi> having ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated for his pretenſions, it was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors part to procure the ratification of the Articles that concerned the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39415:122"/>that Prince, were ſo hard, that if <hi>France</hi> would not mitigate them, and make them more acceptable, they muſt be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out of the Treaty, or declared to be held as not comprehended therein, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperor could not procure them to be ratified, nor by conſequent promiſe to do it. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors made anſwer, That their Kings ratification which they had in cuſtody, being ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionated, that of the Emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be ſo too; ſo that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found by experience, that into whoſe hands ſoever he committed his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Intereſts, he was not to hope for ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Conditions, as he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the <hi>French</hi> King, if he had wholly referred himſelf to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> made the anſwer of the other Ambaſſadors a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for his delaying to give a return to the Declaration of the <hi>French,</hi> until ſuch time as he might have orders from the Elector his Maſter: So that although he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer on the 11, yet he declared that it was only in expectation of inſtructions, that no advantage might be drawn from his ſilence. But as he would not directly complain of <hi>France,</hi> he imputed to <hi>Sueden</hi> all the cauſe of the ſeverity which he found in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:39415:123"/>Declaration of the 24th of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Ambaſſador ſaid, that ſuch a kind of Declaration could not have been made, but at the inſtance of <hi>Sueden;</hi> that his Electoral Highneſs would be much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, to find that that Crown charged him with unwillingneſs to accept of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Propoſitions of Peace, ſeeing the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors could not deny, but that it was themſelves who refuſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Projects of Peace, which he gave in to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediator, by expreſs Orders from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; that, moreover, he did not believe that it was the intention of the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to make it be thought that the ſatisfaction which his Electoral Highneſs pretended, did offer violence to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> nor that what <hi>Sueden</hi> poſſeſſed in the Empire was become unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as if the States and Territories of the Empire could not paſs from one to another of its Members, without violating of thoſe Treaties: that upon that ground only his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Peace with the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who retained ſome part of that which <hi>Sueden</hi> heretofore poſſeſſed in the Empire, and that the Elector his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter might with much more juſtice pretend
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:39415:123"/>to a ſatisfaction of the ſame nature. He furthermore added, That his Electoral Highneſs would be amazed to underſtand that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould pretend to make him pay the charges of the War, and much more to dipoſſeſs him of <hi>Leipſtadt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any formality, contrary to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Empire, and the very Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> and that with ſo much the leſs reaſon, that the Count of <hi>Lippe,</hi> to whom the half of <hi>Leipſtadt</hi> belonged, had not the leaſt quarrel with <hi>Sueden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All who, were leſs concerned than <hi>France</hi> in the reſtauration of <hi>Sueden;</hi> and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators themſelves ſaid openly, That the too great obſtinacy with which that Crown pretended to the intire reſtitution of all that it had loſt during this War, would be an inſuperable obſtacle to the peace. That it was not to be expected that <hi>Sueden</hi> would make too much haſte to end the War, ſince the Eight hundred thouſand Crowns of Subſidy which that King had from <hi>France,</hi> were better to him than the Revenues of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and all that he poſſeſſed in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> That if the <hi>French</hi> King did not by his Power make the peace of <hi>Sueden,</hi> that Crown would never make the leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards it, eſpecially ſo long as it was ſo well ſupported by the men and money of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:39415:124"/>
               <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors having ſeen the Anſwer that the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſador made, thought fit to reply to it on the 14th. ſaying, That the <hi>French</hi> King's deſign being to make the peace of the Empire univerſal, his Majeſty had ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Treaty, that he ſhould employ all his Offices with the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> and the Emperor the like with his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to incline them to conſent to a truce for better carrying on of the peace. That the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ambaſſadors were the firſt that conſented to it, even by the Treaty, whilſt that thoſe of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> were ſo far from condeſcending to what had been ſtipulated for them, that on the contrary they had proteſted againſt the Treaty, and uſed ſtill all their endeavours to incline the Empire to prefer the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the War before the ratification of the peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſubjoined, That it was this procedure of the Confederates which had given occaſion to his Majeſty of taking more efficacious meaſures for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a general peace with as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition as the good of the people requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and therefore for making the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> which was ſo much the more reaſonable in the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:39415:124"/>it contained, in that all equity allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thoſe who ſhare moſt in the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of War, ſhould make likewiſe the greateſt advantages of it.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> with whom peace was made, was at preſent moſt expoſed to the paſſage of Forces; and his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty not deſiring to make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Armies to the prejudice of the Empire, was willing thereby to gratifie that Prince of all the reſt, to whom the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of a War, which the obſtinacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſtill in the Empire, was moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial. At length the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors declared that they would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any propoſition, unleſs the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> was fully admitted.</p>
               <p>All men were of opinion, that the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms mentioned in the Treaty of Peace betwixt the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> was the moſt proper means of compaſſing the Peace of the North. And therefore the Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> finding that the <hi>French</hi> charged him in their Reply, with refuſing to accept of that Ceſſation, and that at the ſame time they declared that they could not admit of any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which was not grounded on the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:39415:125"/>of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> thought himſelf obliged without further delay to make an Anſwer, which he did the 16th.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, That if by a repugnancy which is common on ſuch occaſions, he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved what the Imperial Ambaſſadors had concluded with <hi>France</hi> to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his Maſter, it could not be inferred from thence, that he was unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ceſſation of Arms, ſeeing he had made known to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to conclude it upon reaſonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That as the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had cauſe to be very well ſatisfied with the Mediators; ſo their Ambaſſadors ought not, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Orders, to have the ſame reſpect for the offers of the Imperial Ambaſſadors, that thoſe of <hi>Sueden</hi> ought to have for the care that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors took of the concerns of that Crown; and ſo much the rather, becauſe that if in this juncture <hi>France</hi> particularly performed the Articles of the League betwixt it and <hi>Sueden,</hi> it was manifeſt that the Emperor did violate that which was contracted betwixt him and the Princes whom he abandoned.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador added, That the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor his Maſter had only engaged in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:39415:125"/>War, to maintain the Peace of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> againſt the Invaſion of <hi>Sueden:</hi> That his Electoral Highneſs was willing to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed what he could to the preſervation of that Peace in its full force; but that ſince it was the intent of the ſame Peace, that thoſe who ſhould break it, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of thoſe that are comprehended therein, ſhould make reparation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentence of the Emperor and Empire; there was nothing more juſt, than to put in execution the Decree which the Emperor and Empire had given againſt <hi>Sueden</hi> in the preſent caſe; and that it was far greater obſtinacy to refuſe that which was reaſonable, than to pretend to what was lawfully ones due.</p>
               <p>The Mediators in the mean time, and the Ambaſſadors of all the Princes, who had made their Peace, perceiving that the Month of <hi>March,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King allowed as the longeſt delay to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> was drilled on in debates and diſputes in Writing, without any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous application to the promoting of the Peace, ſolicited the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to conſent to a ceſſation of Arms, during all the following Month, not doubting but in that time all the difficulties that hindered the concluſion of the general
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:39415:126"/>Peace might at length be removed.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſolicitations made the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors declare to the Mediators, on the 26. that in compliance with the Inſtances that had been made to them, both by them, and the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck,</hi> in name of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> for a ſuſpenſion of Arms until the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> they conſented in name of the King their Maſter, and his Allies, to a ceſſation during the whole Month of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> provided the ſame Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> accepted of it without delay, ſaying, it was neither the fault of them, nor of their Allies, that that Truce was not granted at the time that they ſigned the Peace with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, according to the offers that were made then; but that it was the proteſtations of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> only which was the cauſe it did not then take effect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors declared to the Mediators at the ſame time, that they had not only received the ratification of the Peace, which they had ſigned with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Ambaſſadors the 5th of <hi>February;</hi> but that alſo his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſee that Peace with all expedition accompliſhed for the repoſe of the Empire,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:39415:126"/>he had ſent them a commiſſion for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Treaty; ſo that ſince it was not his fault that the Empire did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reap the fruits of ſo deſired a Peace, if it happened that the ratification of the Emperor ſhould not be exchanged within the time preſcribed by the Treaty, they demanded from that inſtant in name of the King, that the demolition of <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and the ſurrender of all <hi>Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gow</hi> might be granted to his Majeſty, and added to the Treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſatisfaction of the charges that he was obliged to be at. And as to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that if that Prince did not in the ſame time fully and plainly rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all that the Imperial Ambaſſadors had ſtipulated for him; his Majeſty in that caſe held himſelf acquitted from all the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he had granted to him.</p>
               <p>The circumſtance which the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors added to their declaration, of the Inſtances which they ſaid were made to them by the Biſhop of <hi>Gurck</hi> in the name of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> ſo ſenſibly touched thoſe two Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that, thinking their Honour thereby much offended, they took a great deal of pains to make the contrary appear, by long anſwers which they made on that ſubject on the eighteenth; affirming that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:39415:127"/>they had never neither deſired nor rejected the ceſſation of Arms: but nevertheleſs, that they might omit nothing that might in any probability tend to the promoting of the Peace, they accepted the Truce upon ſuch conditions as ſhould on both ſides be agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Never were any Ambaſſadors more fond of Writing than thoſe of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> their debates had already occaſioned as many publick Writings du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Month of <hi>March</hi> alone, as had been made during the negotiation of all the other Treaties put together. In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, that they might give theſe Ambaſſadors all the ſatisfaction that they could deſire upon ſo nice a point, declared on the Nineteenth,</p>
               <p>That ſince the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> thought themſelves wronged, in that they could be ſuſpected to have demanded or deſired a ceſſation of Arms, they conſented that the Mediators might give them a publick Act thereupon, to be joyned to the proteſtations which they had made againſt the peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; whilſt that they on the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded that all the proceedings of the King their Maſter for the advancement of the general Peace, in a time when he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:39415:127"/>was in a condition to continue the War with advantage, argued great glory to his Majeſty: They ſtill offered the ceſſation on the ſame conditions which they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediators, without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, in the mean time, from their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> in caſe that the Peace was not ſigned in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and that they accepted not the Truce: But that if they conſented to it for the whole Month of <hi>April,</hi> it was his Majeſties will, that during all that Month, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> might have liberty to conclude the Peace, without requiring the new Conditions that had been demanded of them.</p>
               <p>At length, after ſo many debates and proceedings to no great purpoſe, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ceſſation was ſigned at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> to continue till the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and was exchanged both in name of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty and King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> betwixt the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors on the one part, and thoſe of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> on the other. But ſeeing, that before the ſigning of that Treaty, the <hi>French</hi> Intendant had cauſed Contributions to be demanded from the Country of <hi>Cleves</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Raine,</hi> and that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:39415:128"/>the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors could not promiſe that they ſhould not be pretended, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the concluſion of the ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſame Ambaſſadors conſented by a publick Act, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors ſhould paſs their word for them; that they ſhould Write about it to the King, that they might know his intentions, and that in the mean time no hoſtile execution ſhould be made during the ſpace of Fifteen days; after which, if his Majeſty thought good that theſe Contributions ſhould be exacted, they engaged to give the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Countrey Three days more, to take ſuch meaſures in as they ſhould think fit.</p>
               <p>The Truce that was now ſigned, inſtead of advancing the negotiation, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtopped the courſe thereof during all the time that it laſted; becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors ſticking to their Declarations, there was no more to be ſaid: So that the Two Princes that remained ſtill in War, Judged it more convenient to negotiate their Peace with the King himſelf, than at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> not doubting but that they might promiſe themſelves ſome advantage to their intereſts from Treating rather with a great Prince, than being too headſtrong in defending the ſame at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> by a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:39415:128"/>long train of proceedings, from which they had no great cauſe to expect a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had for that effect, already ſent M. <hi>Meinders</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Court; and his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered M. <hi>de Mayerkron</hi> his Envoy to the States General, to go immediately and wait upon the King. In the mean time, a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> was allarmed at the Fleet which the moſt Chriſtian King was ſetting out to Sea: <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Genoa</hi> were much ſtartled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. <hi>Denmark</hi> feared a deſcent in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Holſtein;</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (where there happened ſuch commotions, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was obliged to depart out of the Kingdom) conceived ſome Jealouſies at the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val preparations.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sweden</hi> having by two ſeveral Couriers, and contrary ways, ſent to the King their Maſter the Treaty of Peace which they had ſigned with the Emperor, that by that means, notwithſtanding the ſeverity of the <hi>Danes</hi> concerning free paſſage, they might receive the ratification in time; theſe two Couriers arrived at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> from ſeveral places the 17th and 18th, with the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:39415:129"/>in good form; But his <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty refuſed to confirm the Treaty, which was concluded with the Princes of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick;</hi> becauſe they thought in <hi>Sweden</hi> that they had yielded to them a great deal too much, and the rather, that the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King indemnified all theſe Princes at his proper charges.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Preſident Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Plenipotentiary from the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> renewed his inſtances with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, that he might obtain ſome moderation of the conditions that had been ſtipulated for his Maſter. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ambaſſadors did alſo the like, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſucceſs: So that they thought it enough to declare that his Imperial Majeſty pretended to be no longer obliged by the Articles that concerned that Prince, by which his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf obliged, and they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that Peace might be deferred until another time; in ſo much that the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts being unwilling that the time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Treaty ſhould expire, without exchanging the ratifications, becauſe of the pretenſions made by the <hi>French</hi> in their laſt declaration of the 26th paſt, they reſolved to make the exchange the 19th of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:39415:129"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 1679, There aroſe an unexpected difficulty concerning the exchange of the ratifications; for the Mediators who had not ſigned the Peace, would not take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: The <hi>Nuncio</hi> likewiſe excuſed himſelf from doing it, becauſe he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt the ſame Peace, in reſpect it was concluded in conformity to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> againſt which <hi>Rome</hi> had then proteſted, becauſe of the revenues of the Church, which they were then obliged to ſeculariſe and yield up to Proteſtants, without which it had been impoſſible to have procured Peace to <hi>Germany.</hi> So that the expedient that was found out, was to make the exchange of the ratifications by the hands of Secretaries, who were reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally ſent on both ſides. And ſeeing the ratifications of <hi>Sweden</hi> were happily arrived the day before, they were exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the ſame manner; ſo that that was a day of Ratifications: The Ratifications of the Treaty of Peace concluded betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> being the ſame day exchanged.</p>
               <p>On the 20th the Envoy of <hi>Lorrain</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted to the Mediators, that the Duke his Maſter pretended not to be obliged by the Articles ſtipulated for him in the Treaty of the Empire; and Eight days after declared
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:39415:130"/>to the ſame Mediators, that though his Highneſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> thought it not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to accept nor ratifie the Articles that concerned him, yet it was not his intention to continue, nor to be reckoned an enemy of <hi>France,</hi> nor of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whoſe humble Servant he proteſted he was; the ſame Declaration was by the ſame Envoy made to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; telling them moreover, that he did it by expreſs order from his Maſter, and not in compliment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Forces that were in the Countrey of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi> ſeeing the time of the Truce expired, and having no advice given them, that there was appearance that the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> would conclude his Peace upon the conditions demanded by the <hi>French</hi> King, put themſelves in a condition the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1679, to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> over which they had made a Bridge at <hi>Ording<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Santhen</hi> is a little Town three Leagues from <hi>Weſel,</hi> whether Monſieur <hi>Blaſpiel</hi> and General <hi>Spaen</hi> went: Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> came there the Third of the Month, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Calvo</hi> who commanded the <hi>French</hi> Forces, was ordered to be preſent, to the end that according to the ſucceſs of that negotiation, he might deſiſt, or purſue the enterpriſes that he was in condition to make: And therefore ſince they were ſtraitened by time, and that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals could not leave their Quarters, this place was choſen as not being far diſtant, for holding of that conference, wherein the very ſame day the Treaty of Truce which was ſigned at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> until the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> was prolonged for Fifteen days, to begin next day the Fourth of the Month; which lengthened the ceſſation of Arms until the 19th, the King being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to grant a longer time, that he might ſooner haſten the Peace, and not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:39415:131"/>leave ſo many people in an uncertainty of a thing they ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>The chief cenditions that M. <hi>Colbert</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the prolongation of the Truce, were, that as a proof of the ſincerity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Elector intended to act with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, General <hi>Spaen</hi> put <hi>Weſel</hi> and <hi>Lipſtadt</hi> into his hands, to be kept by him until the Peace betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Allies on the one part, and his Electoral Highneſs on the other, ſhould be ſigned and ratified. Theſe Conditions ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtranger, in that the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> made no great difficulty in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, offering even to put <hi>Schin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſcance</hi> into his Majeſties hands, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, that he might not any ways allarm the States General, to whom, by the Count <hi>D'Avaux</hi> his extraordinary Ambaſſador, he gave that teſtimony of his good will.</p>
               <p>It was not eaſie to be conceived what could be the policy of the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> in willingly delivering up thoſe places; if he deſired the Peace in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as it was probable, ſince he thereby put himſelf in greater need of concluding it, what advantage did he find in expoſing his Countrey to ruine, for ſome few weeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the concluſion of the Treaty? Or if he had a deſign to defend himſelf, and that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:39415:131"/>he hoped he was able to reſiſt a powerful Army, he might have begun by <hi>Weſel,</hi> which was a ſtrong place, and wherein he had a good Cariſon that might have afforded his Enemies buſineſs upon their entry into his Countrey.</p>
               <p>It was thought that the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> perceived very well that he could not hold out long; and that he knew that if the <hi>French</hi> entered by force, not only that whole Countrey would be utterly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, but that likewiſe there would be ſo great a conſternation throughout all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Territories, that it would be hard for him to ſecure any of them; that upon theſe conſiderations he had yielded up thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he might the better preſerve them; and the rather that with the Forces he drew out of <hi>Weſel</hi> and <hi>Lipſtadt,</hi> he would be in a condition of making a vigorous reſiſtance at <hi>Minden,</hi> and to obtain from <hi>France</hi> more advantageous conditions than thoſe which he could not as yet reſolve to embrace: but before experience made appear how little ſecurity there was in that choice, it was not very hard to foreſee that the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> was not like to find great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby.</p>
               <p>About this time, the Mareſhal <hi>D' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrades</hi> having got leave from the King his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:39415:132"/>Maſter to leave <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> parted from thence with his whole Family on the Fifth, and M. <hi>Colbert,</hi> to whom alone the King referred what remained of the negotiation at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> ſigned the ſame day the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of the Truce with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Denmark,</hi> upon the ſame conditions that were agreed upon at <hi>Santhen</hi> with the Ambaſſador of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> except the Article concerning the places which were to be delivered up to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Meinders</hi> finding no ſucceſs in his Negotiation with his moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, having parted from the <hi>French</hi> Court upon his return to the Elector his Maſter, that he might receive from him more ample inſtructions, and a larger commiſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at that time to <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> where on the morrow the 11th of the Month, he had a long conference with M. <hi>Colbert,</hi> which made it hoped that the Peace of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> would be ſpeedily concluded; but a few days after, M. <hi>Meinders</hi> took his Journey back to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor in the mean time gave no orders to his Ambaſſadors concerning the fulfilling of the Treaty of the Empire; which occaſioned great complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the people of the Countries that were poſſeſſed by the <hi>French;</hi> ſeeing that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:39415:132"/>far from enjoying the fruit of Peace, they found themſelves on the contrary almoſt undone by the vaſt contributions which they payed for maintanance of the <hi>French</hi> Forces; they carried their grievances even to the Mediators at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> and the Nuncio having reported them to M. <hi>Colbert</hi> by a Memoir that he gave him the 14th, that Ambaſſador offered to cauſe the <hi>French</hi> Forces to draw out of the poſts which they poſſeſſed, provided that the Emperor would evacuate the places which his Army held in the Empire, according to the intent of the 27. Article of the Treaty of Peace.</p>
               <p>At that time the Princes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> ſollicited the Mediators, the Ambaſſadors of the Empire, and of <hi>France,</hi> that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they had made with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> might be declared to make a part of the Treaty concluded at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Emperor and thoſe two Crowns. The Imperial Ambaſſadors were for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the affair to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> gave thoſe Princes on the Kings part an Act of incluſion into the Treaty of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> found now that he gained nothing by delaying to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Conditions which the <hi>French</hi> had long ago propoſed to him; for the Forces
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:39415:133"/>that fell into his Countrey of the <hi>Marck,</hi> put him to a ſtand; and thoſe whom he had led into <hi>Pruſſia</hi> againſt the <hi>Suedes,</hi> ſuffered much, and were ruined by the long Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which he cauſed them to make that they might come and defend <hi>Minden.</hi> And therefore his Electoral Highneſs, that he might omit nothing that would tend to his advantage, reſolved to Write to the French King, and to try if he could obtain from his Majeſties generoſity, what he could not hope for by any other means.</p>
               <p>I thought fit here to inſert that Letter at length, becauſe I found it would be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to expreſs the force of ſo fine a Letter by way of abſtract; beſides, unleſs I gave the exact Copy of it, it might probably be hard to be believed that agreat Prince, ſuch as the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> would write with ſo much reſpect and ſubmiſſion to his <hi>Majeſty.</hi>

                     <p>IT is impoſſible but that your Majeſty, according to the great wiſdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:39415:133"/>with God has endowed you, does eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moderation and juſtice of my pretenſions: and it being ſo, that you muſt offer violence to that Generoſity and Greatneſs of Soul which is natural to your Majeſty, in forcing me to conditions of peace that are not only injurious to me, but ignominious alſo. God, who is juſt, ſeeing the righteouſneſs of my Cauſe, hath proſpered my Arms with the conqueſt of all <hi>Pomerania;</hi> and your Majeſty makes me give back the greateſt part of it, which I put into your hands that I may preſerve the reſt, which is but a ſmall matter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of what I have gained with the loſs of my blood and the ruine of my ſubjects. Is it not then juſt, my Lord, that ſince your Majeſty obliges me to part from ſo great and fair Cities, and ſo much of my Enemies Countrey, you ſhould likewiſe oblige the <hi>Suedes</hi> to leave me the reſt; and that your Majeſty having ſo far concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelf for the party that had no right to demand any thing, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your ſelf alſo for him who had right to keep all, but yet yields the greateſt part meerly in condſieration of your Majeſty? I am informed that your Miniſters object to me the Intereſt of your Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and know that that is a powerful
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:39415:134"/>motive to animate a great ſoul to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings: But ſuffer me to put you in mind, That Juſtice is the ſource and rule of Glory; and that I having that on my ſide, it is far greater and more ſolid glory to ſupport a juſt and moderate pretenſion, than to favour one that is nothing leſs. And certainly could your Majeſty but hear the diſcourſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and weigh it with the reaſons that Intereſt ſuggeſts to you from my Enemies, I am confident you would inſtantly decide in my favours, and ſo prevent the judgment of diſintereſted poſterity. Withall, my Lord, I am very ſenſible that the Match is too unequal betwixt your Majeſties Forces and mine, and that I am unable to reſiſt a King who alone hath carried the burden of a War againſt the greateſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Europe,</hi> and hath with ſo much glory and ſucceſs gone through with it: But can your Majeſty find any advantage in the ruine of a Prince who is ſo deſirous to ſerve you; and who being preſerved, may contribute more to your ſervice than a bare willingneſs? Your Majeſty will, certainly, be the firſt that will regret my ruine, ſince you cannot eaſily find in all the world beſides, one who is more really and with greater reſpect and zeal than my ſelf, <hi>Your Majeſties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> alſo, who was not willing to neglect any thing that might give the <hi>French</hi> King freſh evidences of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to merit the favour of his Majeſty, was not ſatisfied with the aſſurances which he had already cauſed to be given to him, but likewiſe got the Mediators to declare to M. <hi>Colbert,</hi> That the Emperor had taken into his ſervice all the <hi>Lorrain</hi> forces; and in the publick Declaration which he made at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> he ſaid that he had delivered his Forces to a Prince at peace with <hi>France,</hi> that he might make appear to the King, that though he was expelled his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet he would do nothing that might give his Majeſty ground to deprive him of the honour of his favour.</p>
               <p>There was no appearance in the mean time that <hi>Germany</hi> would ſo ſoon taſte of the fruit of the Peace, becauſe there was no forwardneſs ſhew'd for the fulfilling of the Treaty: for though the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was very neceſſary for the eaſe of a great many Provinces of the Empire; yet the Imperial Ambaſſadors teſtified no great ſollicitude for attaining to ſo deſired an end. But M. <hi>Colbert</hi> having by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators acquainted them with the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he had received from the King his Maſter to act alone as to the executing of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:39415:135"/>the Treaties, they agreed to meet on the 22. at the Town-Hall of <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> in preſence of Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> Mediator. That Conference laſted four hours, but without any agreement. As to the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the 27. Article of the Treaty of Peace, the Imperialiſts ſaid that they were ready to remove their Forces from the places they poſſeſſed, ſo ſoon as they were required to do it by the States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the Emperor ought to remove them without any requiſition, ſeeing that Article was abſolute, and without conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, equally obliging both parties fairly to evacuate all the places which they poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, within a Month after the exchange of the Ratifications, without further delay.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Reſolution of treating his Peace with the King himſelf, put an end to the Negotiation of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of that Court at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>Monſieur de Meyerkron</hi> was not at firſt favourably accepted of his Majeſty, who refuſed to receive the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>'s Letter, becauſe in that Letter he gave him not the title of Majeſty, though that retarded not long the Negotiation. The King approved of the meaſures that were taken of treating the Peace of the North
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:39415:135"/>in <hi>Schonen.</hi> And M. <hi>Heugh,</hi> Ambaſſador from his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted M. <hi>Colbert</hi> on the 26. with the Conference that was to be held at <hi>Louden,</hi> where M. <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> Ambaſſador from his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty in <hi>Sueden,</hi> was to meet the Miniſter of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ratification of the Treaty of Peace betwixt that Crown and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> was at that time brought to <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> but it was not as yet exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe of ſome difficulties that were found in the Treaty which was ſigned the 22. of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Forces began already to ſpread in the <hi>Marck</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and there came daily new Troops to <hi>Weſel,</hi> to encreaſe the Army which the <hi>Mareſhal de Crequi</hi> was to command; Equipage, Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and all neceſſary Ammunition, were continually brought; and the <hi>French</hi> uſed the greater diligence to put themſelves in a condition of making ſome enterpriſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>M. Meinders</hi> was not at all urgent in his Negotiation with the King. He ſpake but indifferently as to that concern, and ſaid that the Elector his Maſter could not make peace, if <hi>Stetin,</hi> and the countrey beyond the <hi>Oder,</hi> were not given up to him.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:39415:136"/>
               <p>Moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> offered their offices for the promoting of that Peace. The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> offered his Mediation; but the Letter which he wrote to the <hi>French</hi> King upon that ſubject, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been given by M. <hi>de Blaſper</hi> to M <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> to be ſent to his Majeſty, that Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador refuſed to do it, ſeeing the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had a Miniſter at Court, who might diſcharge that office. The Princes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> made alſo ſome inſtances in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo of his Electoral Highneſs, that they might procure a delay in the Military executions, ſeeming to be perſuaded that that peace would not fail to give the King all kind of ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>It was nevertheleſs a rare thing to ſee that it behoved the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors to preſs the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to conſent to the eaſing of the Empire by conſummating of the peace. For this end M. <hi>Colbert</hi> thought a ſecond Conference neceſſary; in which the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts</hi> would not maintain the reaſons which they had alledged in the former, without palpable prevarication. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> 1679. propoſed to the Mediators, that they would bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Conferenee, in which it would be convenient that all the Miniſters of the Prinees of the Empire at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> might
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:39415:136"/>be preſent, to the end it might appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperor or <hi>French</hi> King were the cauſe of the delay of that performance on which the repoſe of ſo many people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. But the Emperors Ambaſſadors thinking that a Conference in preſence of the Miniſters of the Princes of the Empire would injure the Authority of his Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty, abſolutely refuſed it, ſaying that the Decree which they had from the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> ſufficiently authoriſed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to act as his Imperial Majeſty ſhould think fitting touching the concerns of the Peace and preſent War.</p>
               <p>At that time the Miniſter of the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> preſented a Memoir to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, demanding that <hi>Bonne</hi> might be evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Imperial Gariſon; and at the ſame time publiſhed the Reſolution which the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> had taken the 22. of the foregoing Month, whereby the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was entreated to command that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Empire poſſeſſed by the Imperial Troops might be evacuated, ſo that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialins could not refuſe a ſecond Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon that occaſion at the Town-hall. But for all that, it was not poſſible to bring them to condeſcend to the evacuation of the places; pretending that they had not as yet had any advice of that reſult of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:39415:137"/>Dyet of the Empire. Nevertheleſs in regard of the inſtance that had been made by the Miniſter of the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to draw all the Forces out of his Countrey, provided that the <hi>French</hi> drew theirs out of the Countreys of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Juliers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Colbert</hi> could not condeſcend to that Propoſition; but he offered to maintain with all exactneſs at the Kings charges, the Gariſons of the places which his Majeſty had reſerved in the Empire, to be employed for procuring of the Peace of the North, and the ſatisfaction of <hi>Sueden.</hi> The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Ambaſſadors anſwered, That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was obliged to do that from the very day that the Ratifications of the Peace were exchanged: And ſo that ſecond Conference had no better ſucceſs than the former.</p>
               <p>That which moſt vexed the Imperialiſts, was, that they could not obtain by the Peace, that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould reſtore the Ten Towns of <hi>Alſatia</hi> into the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were in before the War; that his Majeſty ſhould draw out his Gariſons, and not poſſeſs them as belonging to him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: And therefore, ſeeing that ſtuck extreamly in their heart, they intended when they made the Treaty for conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:39415:137"/>the Peace, to have comprehended thoſe Ten Towns amongſt the places which <hi>France</hi> ought to evacuate; and in proſpect of that, they put them into the Liſt which at that time they gave of the places of the Empire, from whence the King was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Forces. M. <hi>Colbert</hi> anſwered in general, that his Majeſty was ready to draw out his Gariſons from all the places which they held in the Empire, excepting thoſe that were made over to <hi>France</hi> by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Nimueguen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Anſwer gave no ground to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts to hope that they might obtain by that Negotiation, what they could not gain by the Treaty of Peace, though they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> was not ſo expreſs concerning the Ceſſion of the Ten Towns of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> but that an Article of the ſame Treaty ſeemed to contradict what was clearly explained in another place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Ceſſion. But the Imperialiſts at length waving that pretenſion, declared on the 15th, that they conſented that <hi>France</hi> ſhould evacuate all thoſe places which their Forces held in the Empire, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe that had been yielded to them by the Treaties of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Nimueguen;</hi> and that on their part they were ready to evacuate, not only <hi>Bonne,</hi> but alſo <hi>Treves</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:39415:138"/>and <hi>Keyſerflatern,</hi> in compliance with the inſtances that were made to that effect by the Electors of <hi>Cologne, Treves,</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin;</hi> but that for the other places of the Empire, they ſtill expected the reſolution of the Diet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> affirming that they doubted not but that the Emperor would comply with the deſire of the States of the Empire.</p>
               <p>That Anſwer being by the Mediators communicated to M. <hi>Colbert</hi> on the 16th, that Ambaſſador ſaw ſo little diſpoſition on the part of the Imperialiſts to a ſincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the 27th Article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace, that he held to the laſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he had made, in reſpect that the Emperor, who was much more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than <hi>France</hi> to make that evacuation, ought likewiſe to be more inclined to it, to the end that ſome difficulties which appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently had no other ſcope but the Emperors particular advantage, might no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the general eaſe of the States of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army was in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Minden,</hi> and began to ſtraiten that place, where General <hi>Spaen</hi> pretended to make a vigorous reſiſtance: But the Mareſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> made Monſieur <hi>Calvo</hi> paſs the <hi>Weſer</hi> on the 30th with a party of Horſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:39415:138"/>and Foot, on a Bridge of Boats which he had cauſed to be made, whil'ſt he himſelf, with a Body of Horſe, went to croſs it at a Ford, which he paſſed, partly ſwimming under the Guns of a Caſtle, and in ſight of the Enemies Trenches. The Caſtle was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward taken by the Foot commanded by the Marqueſs of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles.</hi> At the ſame time the Mareſhal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver only with an intent to oblige the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to pay the Contributions which he had demanded, perceiving that General <hi>Spaen</hi> was come out of the Town with above Three thouſand men, and ſome Field-pieces, to diſpute the paſſage of the River, briskly attacqued and defeated that Party. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Spaen</hi> was beat back to <hi>Minden</hi> with conſiderable loſs of men killed, and above four hundred taken priſoners; ſo that the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had cauſe to be fully convinced, that nothing but a Peace could ſecure him from the miſeries which the continuation of the War threatned.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt action that put an end to ſo great a War; and if the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had haſtened but a few days the Negotiation of the Peace which was ſigned at St. <hi>Germans</hi> the day before, the news had come in time to have ſaved a great many brave men, by preventing that Engagement.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:39415:139"/>
               <p>The re-eſtabliſhment of the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> was the ground-work and chief Article of the peace of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> without any derogation from them, except that for avoiding the differences that ariſe commonly amongſt Princes about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of limits. <hi>Sueden</hi> yielded to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> the Territories which that King poſſeſſed beyond the <hi>Oder</hi> before the War, excepting the Towns of <hi>Dam</hi> and <hi>Golnau,</hi> with their dependencies; his Electoral Highneſs being in the mean time to retain poſſeſſion of <hi>Golnau,</hi> until the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> ſhould pay him the ſum of fifty thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sueden</hi> likewiſe gave up the half of the Tole and Cuſtoms which are raiſed at the Port of the Town of <hi>Colberg,</hi> and the other Ports of the Electoral <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> and which were granted by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Stettin</hi> in the year 1653. But <hi>Sueden</hi> had ſtill the Soveraignty of the River of <hi>Oder,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> having no power to ſettle any Tole there.</p>
               <p>That Prince was not exempted from the clauſe which was common to all the other Princes who had made their peace with <hi>France;</hi> to wit, that he could not directly nor indirectly aſſiſt the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> his Ally, if he continued to make war
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:39415:139"/>againſt <hi>Sueden.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> King as an effect of his good will, and for the good of the peace, promiſed by a ſeparate Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to pay, or cauſe to be paid to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor the ſum of Three hundred thouſand crowns, in ſome manner to reimburſe the charges he had been at during the courſe of the War.</p>
               <p>There remained now no Negotiation of importance to be managed at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> but that of the Treaty for fulfilling of the peace concluded betwixt the Emperor and <hi>France;</hi> for the Conferences that were on foot at <hi>Louden</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> or rather the Negotiation that M. <hi>de Meyerkron</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at the <hi>French</hi> Court, gave hopes that ere long the peace would be concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> Upon deſign of haſtning the concluſion of that peace, a conſiderable detachment of Cavalry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Marqueſs of <hi>Joyenſe,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Territories of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> into the Counties of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhurſt,</hi> and put all that Countrey under contribution.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>D' Eſpenſe</hi> paſſed at that time through <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> going with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> and though that peace was ſigned at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> yet the Ratifications of it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:39415:140"/>at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the 22. of <hi>July</hi> 1679. ſo that nothing now detained M. <hi>Colbert</hi> at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> but the concluding with the Imperialiſts the Treaty for fulfilling the peace. Yet he found them not as yet diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to end that buſineſs quickly, though the concluſion of it was ſo neceſſary for the welfare and repoſe of the Empire, that without the ſame, the peace was of no uſe at all to it.</p>
               <p>Matters ſtanding thus, M. <hi>Colbert</hi> thought that it behoved him to put a little more heat into the Imperialiſts than he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was, and to bring them to his hand by all ways imaginable. He found none more proper nor more natural, than to feign a ſudden departure, for which he ſaid he had received Orders; and in that deſign he ſent away a good part of his Equipage and Servants. The Imperial Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors made no doubt but that he had ſuch Orders as he ſaid; and the <hi>Nuncio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred himſelf with the zeal of a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, in ſolliciting the Imperialiſts, to the end that ſo many people ruined by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of War, might not be longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taſting the fruit of peace.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations at length prevailed with the Emperor's Ambaſſadors: for tho' they had been as ſtiff as to the concluſion
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:39415:140"/>of the Treaty of performance, as they had been in reſpect of that of the peace it ſelf; yet they well perceived that the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which they had heretofore uſed for explaining in their favour in the Treaty of <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> what they found advantageous for <hi>France</hi> in the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only tended to confirm the <hi>French</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions as to the Soveraignty of the ten Towns of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> they might likewiſe be aſſured that they loſt time in pretending to gain by the Treaty of Performance, more than they could by the Treaty of Peace; ſo that ſeeing M. <hi>Colbert</hi> had prefixed a day for his departure, they conſented to ſign the Treaty, rather than to leave ſo great a work imperfect.</p>
               <p>By that Treaty which was ſigned the 17. the evacuation was on both ſides to be made the 20th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> from all places in general, which by the Treaties of <hi>Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> and <hi>Nimueguen</hi> belonged neither to his Imperial Majeſty nor to the <hi>French</hi> King, excepting eight places mentioned in the 8th Article of the Treaty of Peace ſigned at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> which the King was to poſſeſs in the Empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the concluſion of the peace of the North.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:39415:141"/>
               <p>Seeing this Treaty was to take effect without any need of giving or exchanging of Ratifications; it was no ſooner ſigned, but that M. <hi>Colbert</hi> left <hi>Nimueguen</hi> that he might return to <hi>France</hi> by the way of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> So that now it may be ſaid that the Aſſembly at <hi>Nimueguen</hi> ended, ſince the chief party left it, and that there was no more to be treated there. Nevertheleſs the Mediators, part of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> and of the States General, made a little longer ſtay at <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> there to ſign the Treaties betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sueden, Sueden,</hi> and the States General. And the Nuncio intending to ſtay until the end, that he might give proofs of the ſincerity of the intentions which he brought to that Aſſembly, was alſo one of the laſt that departed.</p>
               <p>Since all the Princes, who had ſtill ſome concerns to be adjuſted, were comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaties which <hi>France</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the principal parties, and by conſequent all hoſtilities amongſt them ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the greateſt difficulties that remained to be determined, were about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of <hi>Sueden</hi> and the States General.</p>
               <p>The Peace betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sueden</hi> was eaſie to be concluded, ſeeing that in that Negotiation there was no new intereſt to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:39415:141"/>be managed betwixt thoſe Two Crowns: Neither was there any need of a Treaty for that Peace, only ſome Conditions were agreed upon, under which it was to be publiſhed in the Countries of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, and thoſe that depend on <hi>Sueden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt perplexity that happened in that affair proceeded from this, that Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> the Mediator, and the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Sueden</hi> had not, no more than the <hi>French,</hi> for the Reaſons I mentioned before, ſeen the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; ſo that ſince the Mediator could not directly mediate betwixt that Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Spain</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Sueden,</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation on the part of <hi>Spain;</hi> behoved to be managed betwixt Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> by the mediation of the Imperial Ambaſſadors; by this means, and by the great care that the Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador <hi>Jenkins</hi> took in that Affair, the parties agreed upon a form for the re-eſtabliſhment and publication of the Peace betwixt the Two Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sueden;</hi> and the mutual Acts of acceptation being reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally interchanged, the form was ſent to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sueden,</hi> to be ſigned by the Two Kings, and afterwards publiſhed at <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and at <hi>Stockholme</hi> and <hi>Riga</hi> in <hi>Livonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:39415:142"/>
               <p>The ſubſtance of that formulary was, that the Declaration of War, which had been made ſome years ago, eſpecially ſince the 17th of <hi>September</hi> of the foregoing year, betwixt the Kings of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould be reputed as never made; that his Catholick Majeſty conſented that the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> ſhould be comprehended in the Treaty of Peace, which had been ſigned, and ſince ratified betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and then, that his <hi>Suediſh</hi> Majeſty approved that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be comprehended in the Treaty of Peace that had been ſigned and ratified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Imperial Majeſty, and the moſt Chriſtian King; theſe Two Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and declaring that a true, ſincere and Chriſtian Peace be renewed and ſetled betwixt them, their Kingdoms and Subjects, as fully as there had never been War nor any Hoſtility betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The intereſt of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> were attended with ſo many difficulties, that thoſe Two Treaties of Peace and Commerce betwixt thoſe Two Powers, were the laſt that were concluded at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi> So many obſtacles and ſo hard to be ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were ſtarted concerning Navigation, that it would be tedious, and contrary to the deſign I propoſed to my ſelf in writing,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:39415:142"/>if I ſhould enlarge upon the particulars: I ſhall only hint at the principal points on which were founded the difficulties that laſted ſo long.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Peace was ſigned betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another betwixt <hi>Sueden</hi> and the ſame States was begun. The moſt difficult point to be adjuſted in the Negotiation of that peace, was the renewing of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Alliance and Commerce which have been betwixt the two Nations. The <hi>Suedes</hi> inſiſted much upon the renewing of the Treaty of 1673; but it being made when the affairs of <hi>Holland</hi> were in a bad condition, and in hopes that the <hi>Suedes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken to be the Mediators of the peace, would have no occaſion to declare, as they did, for <hi>France:</hi> in proſpect of that, the <hi>States-General</hi> ſcrupled not by that Treaty to grant great advantages to <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> but they would not at all conſent that it ſhould be mentioned in the fourth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Treaty of peace, wherein they only renewed thoſe of 1640. 1645. 1646. and 1667.</p>
               <p>Of ſeven and thirty Articles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Treaty of Commerce and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, there was hardly one which did not produce ſome difficulty. They had already,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:39415:143"/>for almoſt the ſpace of a whole year, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain to ſurmount thoſe obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and therefore it was expected that at the <hi>Hague</hi> rather than <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points in debate would be more eaſily adjuſted. With theſe hopes M. <hi>Oliverkrans</hi> went in the Month of <hi>May</hi> to the <hi>Hague;</hi> and the <hi>States-General</hi> having named Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to treat with that Ambaſſador, they met at the Houſe of the Count <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> who in that juncture performed the Office of Mediator. Beſides, the particular intereſt that the Town of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and ſome other Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> have in the commerce with <hi>Sueden,</hi> requiring more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act informations as to every particular dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; it was reaſonably hoped, that that affair would be more eaſily determined at the <hi>Hague</hi> than at <hi>Nimueguen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had many conferences upon that ſubject. The States demanded a diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the impoſitions that <hi>Sueden</hi> had laid upon bulky commodities, eſpecially ſince the Treaty that <hi>Sueden</hi> made with the States in 1640. Theſe commodities are ſuch as are of a great bulk and ſmall price, as Stone and Marble, Hemp, Wax, Pitch, Tar, Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes, Corn and Timber. But the States wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the three firſt ſort of bulky Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; and the Ambaſſador of <hi>Sueden</hi> after
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:39415:143"/>much repugnancy in two conferences ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, conſented at length that the four other ſorts of bulky commodities ſhould be regulated according to the Rates of 1659. which neverthelſs are but little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thoſe whereof the States complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It was alſo agreed upon, That all duties and cuſtoms unequally impoſed, which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the leſſening of the mutual freedom of Trade, and which have been introduced in <hi>Sueden</hi> ſince the year 1656. ſhould be diſcharged for the future; and that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on both ſides ſhould pay no other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but thoſe that the native ſubjects do pay. Nevertheleſs that equality was not to be obſerved in the Kingdom of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Finland;</hi> that is to ſay, that that clauſe of the Treaty ſhould only reach <hi>Riga</hi> in <hi>Livonia, Ingria, Pomerania,</hi> and the other Dominions of <hi>Sueden</hi> upon the <hi>Baltick</hi>-ſea; the Provinces of <hi>Iſchonen, Bleking,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being reckoned as parts of the ancient Kingdom of <hi>Sueden,</hi> though they be not ſpecified in the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The free and half-free Ships of <hi>Sueden,</hi> gave occaſion to another difficulty: The free Ships are veſſels built for War, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from 24. to 30. piece of Cannon, and are obliged to ſerve in the Kings Fleet in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:39415:144"/>time of War; and therefore the King hath priviledged them in trading in reſpect of duties and cuſtoms, that the benefit which they thereby enjoy, may recompence their ſervice, and ſupply the charges of rigging and fitting of them out, from which Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhips are exempted. By means whereof the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> hath always men trained to the Sea, and a Squadron of about thirty Ships.</p>
               <p>The half-free Ships are Veſſels of about One hundred Tuns burden; their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and number are ſo ſmall, that they cannot be very prejudicial to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Dutch</hi> found, that all theſe priviledged Veſſels might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the greateſt part of the Trade of the <hi>Baltick;</hi> and therefore the States in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted vigorouſly upon the abrogation of all thoſe priviledges, as contrary to the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of advantage which the ſubjects of both Nations were to enjoy: But in that debate the ſame mean was taken which ſerved to remove the former difficulty; and it was agreed upon, that theſe Veſſels ſhould only enjoy their exemptions in the Territories of the Kingdom of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Finland;</hi> and that in the other Provinces on the <hi>Baltick</hi>-ſea, depending on the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> there ſhould be no diſtinction
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:39415:144"/>between <hi>Suediſh</hi> Ships and <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It could not be believed after this, that any new difficulty could retard the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Treaty of Commerce, whereof the Negotiation had laſted above a year: Nevertheleſs there happened one which put a full ſtop to the affair. The Ambaſſadors of the <hi>States-General</hi> had put in the 7th Article of their project, <hi>That the ſubjects on either ſide ſhould be uſed as the Nation in greateſt friendſhip,</hi> ut quaeque gens amiciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Suedes</hi> took occaſion from this, to demand a freedom from the duties which the <hi>Dutch</hi> had impoſed upon the <hi>Suediſh</hi> commodities that paſs the <hi>Sound;</hi> and the rather, becauſe that impoſition was never laid on till the <hi>Suedes</hi> had obtained from the <hi>Danes,</hi> by Treaties concluded to their advantage, and exemption from part of the duties that are exacted in the <hi>Sound.</hi> The truth is, that the States to hinder that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from being prejudicial to the trade of their ſubjects who enjoy not the ſame priviledg, ſetled then in their Countrey upon thoſe that had the priviledg of the <hi>Sound,</hi> and Impoſition almoſt equivalent to that Exemption.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſaid, That the equality which ought to be obſerved in the Trade of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:39415:145"/>two Nations, was not hurt by that kind of compenſation; and alledged that it was ſo little contrary to it, that in all the Treaties which had been concluded in the long time ſince theſe duties were impoſed, the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of them was never thought upon when other Treaties was made.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Suedes</hi> however, who would not loſe to the profit of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> what they obtained to the prejudice of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſtood firmly to that point; ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences at the <hi>Hague</hi> were broken up, and the Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> could not promiſe himſelf to renew them again on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with the ſame ſucceſs that they had had in the other difficulties; inſomuch that M. <hi>Oliver Krants</hi> came back to <hi>Nimueguen</hi> (<hi>Aug.</hi> 1679.) where the Aſſembly being ſhortly after wholly diſſolved, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe Treaties could no longer be prolonged, which yet were not ſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſecond of <hi>October;</hi> the annulling of the Impoſts laid on in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the reduction of thoſe of <hi>Sueden</hi> to the ſtandard of the Treaty of 1640. remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undecided and referred to other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which were to be held at the <hi>Hague</hi> for adjuſting theſe affairs within eighteen Months after the ſigning of the Treaty.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:39415:145"/>
               <p>In the mean time M. <hi>de Mayerkroon,</hi> who had been for ſome time at the <hi>French</hi> Court, perceiving that the conferences in <hi>Schonen</hi> did not advance the Negotiation of the peace betwixt <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> began to ſeem more inclined to conclude the Treaty of the King his Maſter, tho' he had no cauſe to expect more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous conditions than thoſe he had at firſt. On the contrary, experience and example made appear, that it could not but be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to be the laſt in making his peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King on his part, deſiring nothing more than to correſpond with that good diſpoſition, and to render the peace general by the concluſion of that of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> gave for that end, on the 24th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a full power to M. <hi>de Pompone,</hi> and by that means within a few days the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was concluded betwixt his Majeſty and the Kings of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and was ſigned at St. <hi>Germans</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> on the ſame conditions that the King had always propoſed for the full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Ally.</p>
               <p>It is known that his Majeſty declared from the beginning, That he could not make peace with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but upon condition of a full reſtitu ion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:39415:146"/>to <hi>Sueden.</hi> The delays and difficulties that were made thereupon, moved not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to abate any thing of the Treaties of <hi>Roſchild, Copenhaghen,</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> and theſe Treaties were the ground-work of the peace of <hi>Denmark;</hi> in the fourth Article whereof his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty declared, That in conſideration of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, he conſented that the Crown of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> be reſtored to all that it poſſeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War; and to all the Territories, States, Provinces, Towns, and places that have been yielded up and acquired by thoſe three Treaties, and by conſequent to all that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Arms had poſſeſſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that War.</p>
               <p>As to the differences that heretofore happened betwixt the ſubjects of the two Nations by reaſon of the priviledges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions which the <hi>Suedes,</hi> as I ſaid, enjoy from a part of the duties that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> raiſes in the <hi>Sound</hi> and in the <hi>Belt,</hi> the moſt Chriſtian King being uncertain whether or not the intention of the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> was that his ſubjects ſhould any ways make uſe of their priviledges to the prejudice of the revenue of the K. of <hi>Denmark,</hi> thought fit ſo to order affairs by that Treaty, that Commiſſioners named by each party, ſhould meet three months after the exchange of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:39415:146"/>Ratifications, and by the mediation of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter appointed by his Majeſty, adjuſt all theſe differences in an amicable way.</p>
               <p>The Reſtauration of the Duke of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Holſtein-Gottorp</hi> having been one of the conditions on which the <hi>French</hi> King conſented to this Peace; it was likewiſe one of the greateſt difficulties that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the carrying on of the Treaty. That Prince was ſtript of all by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> only for being an Ally to the King of <hi>Sueden;</hi> and therefore ought to be reſtored to all again: To which, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as an evidence of the deſire he had to put an end to the War with all expedition, conſented at the deſire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the <hi>French</hi> King; granting that the Duke of <hi>Sleſwick Holſtein-Gottorp,</hi> ſhould enjoy his Territories, Provinces, Towns and Places, in the ſame ſtate as they were in at the ſigning of the Treaty, with all the Soveraignty that belonged to him by virtue of the Treaties of <hi>Roſchild, Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> That Prince could hardly pretend to more, unleſs it were the damage that his Territories had ſuffered during the War, by the vaſt ſums of Money that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as being one of the beſt Countries of all the North.</p>

               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who made their ſeparate Treaties, after that the Peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> received profitable teſtimonies of the deſire that the <hi>French</hi> King had of giving repoſe to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> for his Majeſty was willing to eaſe them of part of the charges of the War, by giving them large ſums of Money, in conſideration of their good inclinations towards the Peace, and particularly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who has not been wanting on his part, to give conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages to all theſe Princes: But the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is the only Prince who has not only reſerved none of his Conqueſts; but likewiſe the ſole enemy of <hi>Sueden,</hi> to whom <hi>France</hi> hath allowed no conſideration for his charges. Seeing the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was at that time in a condition to demand Reaſon of the State of <hi>Hambourg,</hi> in relation to ſeveral pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he has upon that City, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerning the Homage that he claims from it; he drew all his Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Town immediately after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace with <hi>Sueden.</hi> The truth is, his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty had not not an Army ſtrong enough to force ſuch a City as <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:39415:147"/>and the more, becauſe the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes concerned themſelves in its preſervation: But the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> coming at firſt as near to it as he pleaſed, by reaſon of the neighborhood of <hi>Altena,</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Batteries for his Artillery and Bombes, with which he might eaſily have incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> 1679, In this Inſtant the moſt Chriſtian King wrote to the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> intreating him not to diſturb the repoſe that the general Peace had given to all <hi>Europe</hi> almoſt: and the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who had already ſent Forces into <hi>Hambourg</hi> to provide for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, interpoſed vigorouſly for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, which was proviſionally concluded the firſt of <hi>November;</hi> the Rights of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and of the City of <hi>Hambourg</hi> remaining as they were, until that the point of Homage and the other differences which depended betwixt his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty and that Town, ſhould in an amicable way be decided by courſe of Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 1679, The chief condition of that agreement, was an obligation by the Town of <hi>Hambourg,</hi> to pay, at Five Terms, to his <hi>Daniſh</hi> Majeſty, the ſum of Two hundred and twenty thouſand Crowns; in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:39415:148"/>conſideration whereof, that King remitted the indignation he had conceived againſt that Town, renounc'd the pretenſions that he had to the Lands jointly poſſeſſed by <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and <hi>Lubeck;</hi> and promiſed to reſtore the Ships, Goods, Commodities and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Hambourg,</hi> which had been ſeiſed by reaſon of theſe pretenſions.</p>
               <p>Thus ended that great War, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were engaged from the year 1672. But it was not enough for the good and repoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the general peace put an end to all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the War; theſe mournful Scenes of ſo bloody a Tragedy required at length ſome pleaſing Cataſtrophy, which might ſweeten the memory of paſt miſeries, and fill the people with more agreeable hopes. Nothing was more proper to produce ſuch an effect than the Marriage of the chief Princes who had had a ſhare in the War, ſeeing theſe new Alliances were ſacred ties to render the Peace indiſſolvable.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ratified the Peace with <hi>France,</hi> but that he thought upon confirming it by a new Alliance with the <hi>French</hi> King; ſo that though the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> were far engaged with the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or for the Marriage of the Imperial Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with his Catholick Majeſty, yet it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:39415:148"/>not that Prince from converting all his thoughts towards <hi>France.</hi> The Picture of Madamoiſelle <hi>de Valois,</hi> and the Royal qualities of that Princeſs, made him reſolve the laſt Spring to cauſe the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbaſes</hi> to go from <hi>Nimueguen</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Court, in quallity of Ambaſſador extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to demand her in Marriage.</p>
               <p>That Miniſter went ſuddenly into <hi>France,</hi> and in a private Audience which he had of the King about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> he demanded of his Majeſty Madamoiſelle in Marriage for the King his Maſter; but his Majeſty gave no anſwer to the Ambaſſador concerning an affair of that importance until the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> at which time he declared that he granted Madamoiſelle to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> That Kingdom being mindful that <hi>France</hi> had always given them good Queens, the people were extreamly overjoyed at the news; but the young Monarch eſpecially, who was deeply ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the merit of that Princeſs.</p>
               <p>The Ceremony of the Marriage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at <hi>Fontain-bleau</hi> the laſt day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> with all the magnificence that could be expected from the <hi>French</hi> Court. The Procuration which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſent blank, to be filled up with the name of him whom the King ſhould think fit to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:39415:149"/>for eſpouſing the Queen, was given to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who gave his Hand to that Princeſs in the name of his Catholick Majeſty; and the Queen ſometime after took her Journey for <hi>Spain,</hi> not without ſhedding of Tears, which teſtified that the regret of leaving <hi>France</hi> was more ſenſible to her, than the joy of poſſeſſing a Crown.</p>
               <p>The Heroick qualities both of body and mind which met in the perſon of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> gained ſo much of the eſteem and affection of his Majeſty, that he thought it not enough to give him a very ſpecial mark of it, by making choice of him to eſpouſe the Queen of <hi>Spain;</hi> but ſhortly after gave him more ſenſible teſtimonies of the ſame, by beſtowing upon him in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Madamoiſelle <hi>de Blois,</hi> whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty tenderly loves. That Marriage was celebrated with ſo much ſplendour, and with ſo univerſal approbation, that the Court never appeared more magnificent, nor better ſatisfied than upon that occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Marriage of the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrica</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, before the rupture betwixt <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> by this laſt War: yea, even from that time, ſtately Coaches, and ſome things that were neceſſary for the Pomp of that Marriage, were providing in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:39415:149"/>
                  <hi>France;</hi> ſo that after the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt thoſe Two Kings, it was not hard to make up that new Marriage: But ſeeing thoſe Princes had ſtill a great deal to do to regulate affairs within and without their Kingdoms, and eſpecially the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who was to retake poſſeſſion of ſeveral Provinces, and to give orders for ſetling them again in the condition that they were in before the War; the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that Marriage was delayed until the Spring: In the mean time part of the Equipage for that Ceremony was preparing at <hi>Hambourg;</hi> and Clothes and other things which were ordered to be made in <hi>France,</hi> were expected from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> 1679, The <hi>French</hi> Court alſo laid aſide all thoughts of War, Feaſting and Divertiſements were the dayly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there; and the Marriage of the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> was hardly over, when the King thought on that of the Dauphin. Men caſt their eyes on all the Princeſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> being curious to know for whom that great fortune was deſtin'd by Heaven; but his Majeſty pitched upon the Princeſs <hi>Anne Marie Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for whom alſo the Dauphin ſeemed to have greateſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. M. <hi>Colbert,</hi> who was juſt returned from <hi>Nimueguen,</hi> was ſent into <hi>Bavaria</hi> to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:39415:150"/>treat about the Marriage, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all the Articles, and ſigned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract thereof the 30th of <hi>December,</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the King ſent the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> into <hi>Bavaria</hi> with preſents for the Princeſs, who being accompanied by Forty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, performed the journey by Poſt.</p>
               <p>The Court at that time prepared for the Journey which the King deſigned in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> to go meet the Dauphineſs as far as <hi>Tholous,</hi> where the ceremonies and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Marriage were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed the Dauphineſs in name of the Dauphin at <hi>Munichen.</hi> The King in the mean time acquainted all neighbouring Princes with that Marriage, by Letters which he wrote to them, wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the piety and great vertues wherewith that Princeſs is endowed, have given his Majeſty juſt cauſe to hope, that that alliance will produce to <hi>France,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſhall worthily anſwer the greatneſs of ſo Auguſt a Birth.</p>
